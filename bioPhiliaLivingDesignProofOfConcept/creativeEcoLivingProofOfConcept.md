# Bio*Philia* Living Design ~ Learning to live in the light of Nature.
(*Proof of concept: Oct 2016 - Jan 2020*)

**The cultivation of a symbiotic habitat, that honors the individual as a *biological organism* in the *built environment*, within the *biophysical environment.***

## *Becoming a part of the circle of life.* The *symbiotic relationships* between *Wo-Man and Mother Earth* (environment) is highlighted, not human and 'things'.

***Harvesting Knowledge:*** Cataloging experiences, sources in the natural environment, of positive biological, physical and  emotional states that humans experience then, recreate them in the built and cultivated environments to enhance emotional, mental, physical and biological health.

Civilized living; life-giving and life-sustaining with a high degree of refinement and comfort. Adaptable to all practical needs of life within an attractive built environment.

![Floor chairs on platform and patio.](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumLivingRoom/vivariumLiving02Web.JPG)

***Curated to allow enjoyment of nature as freely as possible.***

Wo-Men have an inherited need to connect to nature and other biotic forms due to their *Evolutionary Dependence* on it for *Survival* and *Personal Fulfillment.* This is the shared human birth wright, their biological need to connect with things that make living possible.

![*Patio garden bird.*](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumPatio/vivariumGTPatioBirdweb.JPG)

#### *Naturally tap into the abundant emotions of joy, grace, awe, wholeness, passion and compassion that are experienced from beauty in nature. An archaic revival of Wo-Mans symbiotic microbial Gaian connection, honoring the feminine by connecting soil to soul.*

![moringa tree bloom](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumGarden/vivariumMoringaFlowers02Web.JPG)

***Cross Pollinate; be the *gardener*, an open hand bringing seed to soil, the womb, the beginnings of life, love and endings. Each bloom in the doing of this most holy act.***

Using the symbiotic relationship with *'Mother Earth'* as a path of discovery into the unique characteristics of intentional independent habitats, that not only can influence a spontaneous therapeutic act but also can be used by the designer to open; they are dynamic, adaptable and can be experienced, offering a safe space and the possibility for trying out inventive solutions and transformation.

#### *Psychobiology, where mind meets matter. The interaction between bio-logical systems and behavior.*

![Hanging Gardens window with jute and bamboo Moringa room](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumWindowHanging/vivariumGTDoubleWindowViewWeb.JPG)

***People are deeply nourished by the process of creating wholeness.***

***Healing environments*** allow one to draw emotional support from their settings through the Symbiotic Energy, the living energy of the space. One then feels free to move around and interact unselfconsciously, to combine ones life with the life of the living systems and elements within the built space. Achieved by bringing in a number of high quality visual and intuitive interactions among the bio-logical ecosystems and elements of a built space and its users.

![Open Space living room, stone floor](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumLivingRoom/vivariumGTLivingroomRelaxWeb.JPG)

A living design built upon the inherent intuitive 'biophilic' response to built forms, natural settings and systems. Designed to generate healthy interactions by encouraging their spontaneous occurrence. New ways of thinking, seeing and relating to the Natural World can be expanded, experienced. Causing a total shift of posture, perceptions, beliefs, and thought processes. Transforming ones relationship with the Natural World.

#### *Authentic Living Design; creating symbiotic living environments that support, restore and regenerate both the physical body and the environment (earth body) have positive effects on the health of a population as a whole, not just the individual within the living design.*

**Just as the ancients danced to call upon the spirits in nature, she too, can dance to find the spirits within herself that have long been buried and forgotten.**

#### Discover what kind of meaning to give it ...

**Life is in motion, every day movement is a dance, what one sees, smells, hears, how one brings their consciousness to the experience, to a tree, and then brings it into the body, that becomes the dance; the experience of the breath made visible. The movment has a purpose, to achieve something real in ones life. Dancing with life on the line, creates a sense of reverence for the process.**

... starting over ... nothing lasts ... What she does have control over is how she copes with what happens, change. ...

**Art is a way** ...  finding a common way to move forward through to nature ... finding the commonalities.

#### *Cure is a medical intervention, healing is becoming whole.*

**Recapture the integration between life and art ... living the creativity is the most important thing one has. Dance the essence of things.**

#### _The denial, the courage to confront, the release ... flow again ..._

Urban environments are not nurturing environments in and of themselves, but with care can become so, curated and cultivated to be so. Breaking the role of 'consumer culture' of 'modern culture,' hanging up the 'cultural costume' and designing a lifeStyle of ones own, connected through too nature. Honoring the uniqueness of the self, breaking free of boundaries, to have reverence for ones own body. Avoiding pre-stylization of movement in life, taking off the 'cultural amour', allowing direct experience to evoke feelings. Going beyond, using the feeling to expand into the 'living' style of ones life through the kinesthetic sense.

**Love,** to feel how things are so that the physical body recognizes itself as part of nature.
***Cultivating intimacy with nature.***

![Authentic Living](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumLivingRoom/livingRoomCandidCafeWeb.jpg)

### *Knowledge Harvested* from the 'symbiotic co-evolutionary experience' and theory are shared here.

**An effort to cultivate personal potential and help others do so in the process.**

Change comes with discovery, that is the way.

Her power to create is limited entirely by the rules she happens to have in her language *now.* In the beginning was the logos, and the logos was made flesh.

#### *The way out is a personal responsibility, the way out is in the soil. When the soil is healed the soul follows.*

***It's time to call home.***
***To act and that act to transfer through nature.***

![Home](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumLivingRoom/vivariumLiving015Web.JPG)

***Welcome to the***
#### *Vivarium ~ place of life*

*An interactive space curated to explore, learn, reflect, ... on how Wo-Man interact, impact and live in their personal environments; homes, work, travel, ..., spaces.*

**Vivarium**- (Latin, literally for "place of life"; plural: vivaria or vivariums) is an area, usually enclosed, for keeping and raising animals (in this case Wo-Man and biological ecosystems) or plants for observation or research. Often, a portion of the ecosystem for a particular species is simulated on a smaller scale, with controls for environmental conditions.

![Harmonize with the Natural World.](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumLivingRoom/vivariumGTLivingroomPatioweb.jpg)

#### *The Aim; to Harmonize the Natural World within the Modern World.*

**Quality of Life**- *Mind, Body, Earth; Anima Mundi (world soul) Symbiotic Ecological Connections. Creating live and dynamic, open independent spaces that feel as they have existed long before ones arrival and will remain long after their depart.*

![An Enchanted Sensibility To Create Change](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/VivariumDouble/moringaRoomCandid01Web.jpg)

**Environ-mental Health** - An enchanted sensibility can be strategically cultivated to ***'Capitalize On The Use Of The Senses To Create Change'.***

***Physical body is the placebo;*** the mind’s natural capacity to influence bodily functions and symptoms.

**Co-evolutionary ecosystems:** Re-establishing and encouraging healthy symbiotic connections with nature (Mother Earth) through sensory experiences; physical and biological interactions, movement, and hands-on activities. Allowing the brain, body and earth body to establish new, more productive patterns.

![Harvest](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumHarvest/vivariumLivingHarvest01Web.JPG)

Inventing a new universe to live in, a universe of possibility. A place where people are continually discovering how they create their reality, and how they can change it.

#### Location

**George Town, Penang**

Due to the intermingling of the various ethnicities and religions that arrived on its shores, George Town acquired a large eclectic assortment of Colonial and Asian architectural styles. It also gained a reputation as gastronomic paradise.

The Vivarium, central to many George Town attractions and just 500 meters from "Link Bike" a public bike rental station. Pulau Tikus Market/Hawker Center: 1.2km, Botanical Garden: 3.2km and UNESCO World Heritage Site: 2.6km.

**The Neighborhood**

![Street viiew](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumMis/dunnRoadGeorgeTown_20170101.jpg)

The surrounding low density neighborhood is tranquil with many large trees, and properties with plenty of green space.

#### The Building and Property

A residential, 3-story apartment building with 15 exclusive units, each 1230 square feet in size. With permission, residents were voluntary participants in composting and a small food garden was under personal cultivation.

#### *The Vivarium ~ place of life*

In October 2016 occupancy was privately secured for one of the 3rd floor corner units, north-facing with 3 bedrooms.

![Dunn House Exterior](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumMis/vivariumPatioOutside01.jpg) 

The unique design of the boutique residence offers each corner condo, three outside walls with large opening garden windows. Due to this design the Vivarium enjoyed a wonderful open feel and fantastic cross breeze.

![Vivarium Flow](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumLivingRoom/vivariumFlow.JPG)

A conscious decision to experience the smell, sound and feel of an A/C free environment was made (a bold move at 5 degrees north of the equator).

![relax living](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumLivingRoom/vivariumLiving01Web.JPG)

Intentional privacy screening was installed allowing guests to keep bedroom doors open; too take advantage and contribute to the natural flow of fresh air. 

![Eco Window Covers](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumWindowHanging/vivariumGTWindowCoversDinning.jpg)

Jute window covers where installed to provide natural air-conditioning. Additionally an evaporative cooler was used in the common area that supported the creation of a very pleasant and natural micro climate. (More details on Eco-deco and micro climates will follow in a separate post.)

![Work](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumPatio/patioWorkVivarium.jpg)

**The Private Medicinal Food Garden;** boasted over ***27 large 5 gallon (or larger) containers*** located outside all bedroom windows, as well as ***22+ clay pots*** on the balcony. Nearly all plants being edible, medicinal or functional. 

![passion flower](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumGarden/patioPassion.jpg)

Besides an assortment of herbs, aloe plants, and experimental seedlings like Durian the garden was home to 23 Moringa oleifera trees, Papaya trees, Coconut seedlings, Sacha inchi vines and a passion fruit vine (that tried to take over the laundry wire) where among the numerous plants.

![hanging patio garden](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumPatio/kokedama03.jpg)

It became difficult to catalog the ever changing garden. Growing a diverse garden is part of what made it a pleasure and easy to enjoy the discovery process towards an Eco-responsible lifestyle. ***The gardens of the Vivarium, once established, provided (and often exceeded) all nutritional requirements for the host and co-host.*** (More details on plant selection and care will follow in a separate post.)

![Kokedama](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumWindowHanging/vivariumKokedama01Web.jpg)

All rooms having several opening windows with large concrete window boxes provided ample space for gardens, easy access and beautiful ambience. The windows being covered in jute became gardens themselves and where home to over ***40+ bamboo hanging planters and Kokedama*** (苔玉, in English, literally "moss ball") a ball of soil, covered with moss, held by being wrapped in coconut cord on which ferns and other medicinal plants grew.

![Eco Deco](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/VivariumMasterBed/vivariumGTEcoDecoMaster01Web.JPG)

Guests where offered garden care responsibilities and to participate in any activities that may have been happening at the time. Guests where also encouraged to use the in-house [Eco friendly body, home and earth care products.](../lifeStylesForChange/waterAlchemy.md) Bathrooms had bidet water hose installed and small cotton towels were provided in place of toilet paper.

![Master Bedroom](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/VivariumMasterBed/vivariumMasterBed01Web.JPG)

At times the entire space was made available, mostly there was a live in host (curator) or co-host that helped the project literally stay alive, always self selected and in harmony with the concept. Guests where offered laundry service and a small 'A La Carte Menu' was also available for a modest fee.

![mangoGinger](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumGarden/mangoGingerHarvestVivariumApril2018.jpg)

#### *Marketing*

**The Vivarium experience was marketed to "Creative Eco-Conscious Travelers" using Airbnb and Workaway platforms with a small team of dedicated local friends that helped make it all possible. The Vivarium listings attained "super host" status on the Airbnb platform.**

![living-room](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumLivingRoom/vivariumGTLivingroomDinningweb.jpg)

Guests joined a journey of discovery as the Vivarium co-evolved and provided a space to share solutions to everyday environmental impacts; [Bokashi soil building](../lifeStylesForChange/soilAlchemy.md) and [pro-biotic enzyme cleaners](../lifeStylesForChange/waterAlchemy.md) were a large part of keeping the ecological footprint positive. This knowledge was freely shared to inquiring guests.

![Evolution](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumPatio/vivariumEvolutionWeb.JPG)

Every stay mattered to this self funded project, contributed and kept this creative living eco space alive, evolving and available to experience.

![deco](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/VivariumDouble/vivariumDouble03Web.JPG)

**Vivarium LifeStyle** - Bringing the unique human touch and spirit back from the generic manufactured sea of junk made available by the faceless factory market place. Functional Eco-decor was handcrafted from natural bamboo, wood, coconut and rattan. Handmade textiles of organic cotton, silk and hemp decorated the walls.

![Patio Living](./vivariumGeorgeTownGallery/vivariumLivingRoom/vivariumGTLivingroomYogaweb.jpg)

Living room was an open shared space, with beautiful cooling white marble floors, very spacious for any kind of body work. The furniture was locally custom built and designed to encourage healthy body movement, to relax and/or work. Space was ample to enjoy a tea on the patio and experience the company of visiting birds, that where always around, singing, exploring and foraging in the gardens that surrounded the unit.
