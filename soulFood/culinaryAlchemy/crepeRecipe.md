# *A Simple Technique For Sourdough Crêpes*

## *The Queen Of Flat Bread, Crêpes are easy to make.*

### A fermented twist to a traditional French street-food staple, these delicious breads can be dressed up with sweet or savory toppings and a myriad of flavorful fillings.

#### Crêpes can be served hot or cold and are equally delicious when dry toasted to reheat.

When reheating, for ease of mobility cut in half or quarter. Once toasted they can be nut buttered or seasoned and further cut into postage size squares for a crouton substitute.

***Ingredients***

Makes about 10 crêpes

- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 1.5 cups kefir milk
- 3 duck or chicken eggs
- salt mountain or sea
- cooking oil, coconut or equivalent

#### Method

For the batter combine flour and kefir milk in a sealable container. Allow to ferment at room temperature overnight or longer (max 3 days).

Prepare the pan with coconut oil and preheat at low to medium heat (300 watts induction stove).

Blend 1 teaspoon mountain or sea salt into the fermented batter, whisk 3 duck or chicken eggs and blend into batter. If the batter is to thick add kefir milk by the tablespoon until desired consistency is achieved.

Mix well, cook on a well oiled pan approximately 2-3 minutes per side. Depending on the consistency of the batter cooking time will vary, for a very thin batter 2 minutes with an additional 1 minute once flipped is usually adequate.

Using a ladle, drop batter evenly onto the center of the pan, lift the pan swirling or gently shake to thin and evenly coat. The crêpes can be smaller than the diameter of the pan for ease of access, especial when using a standard fry pan.
