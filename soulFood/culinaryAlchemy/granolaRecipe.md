#### *The technique for granola.*

***Ingredients***

Makes about 10 cups

- 6 cups whole rolled oats (or blend 4 cups oats with 2 cups rye) 1.4 L
- 1 cup sunflower seeds 240 mL
- 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds 120 mL
- 1/4 cup undulled sesame seeds 60mL (or any combination of appropriate raw nuts and seeds)
- 2 tsp cinnamon 10 mL (or a combo, ginger and clove ...)
- 2/3 cup sunflower, safflower or coconut oil 160 mL
- 2/3 cup honey 160 mL
- 2 tsp vanilla 10 mL
- 1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut 240 mL (optional to add after with fruit)
- 2 cups of dried fruit: raisins, blueberries, cranberries, cherries, chopped dry apricots, various wild foraged and dried berries, ... . 

Dried fruit is added after the granola has been cooked and cooled. If using toasted seeds or nuts they are also added after the granola is cooked.

To avoid shredded coconut becoming over cooked toast on its own and add once the granola is cool (or add raw). 

The granola will keep well for one month in a sealed container. 

#### Method
(stove top friendly)

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.

In a large oiled roasting pan (or mix in a bowl and transfer to baking sheets), deep dish fry pan or stock pot, combine oats, nuts and seeds.

In a small saucepan, warm the oil and honey under low heat, stir continuously until blended. Take the honey and oil off the stove, blend in the vanilla and spices. Pour mixture over dry ingredients, with a large spoon, toss well until granola is shiny and well coated.

Bake until golden, stirring every 15 - 20 minutes in the oven. For stove top, toast until golden under medium heat, stirring regularly as needed to not over cook. It takes about an hour to bake at 250 degrees, less time at a higher heat. The granola may still be slightly soft but will crisp up as it cools. Cool completely before storing in an airtight container.
