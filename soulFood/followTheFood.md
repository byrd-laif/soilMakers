# *From Soil To Plate To Soil*

## The *Life - Death - Life* Cycle Of Soul Food.

### *To whence it comes from, to wherein it is going, and to whither it will become.*

#### Nature creates conditions for life, she can't force it and she can't fake it. Things must undergo the formality of actually occurring. Its the soil and plants as part of a *symbiotic partnership* that make soul food plausible.

#### Woman is A Religion of; The redemption of Earth through magic. Meaningful work; an Act that transfers through to nature, the microbial soil, symbiotically healing Wo-Man too the Womb of Mother Earth. To be indigenous of a land means caring for it's next generations use.

***Its not that nature is alive its that its intelligent. The felt experience of being in organism; standing as a mirror before nature as its object. Its not to see life, its to recognize it when its seen. Woman is nature and as such, she can speak for Mother Earth.***

**This will document the alchemical journey of *Soul Food,* from its soil source, cultivation, harvest, preservation/preparation to culinary delight, and its multi dimensional return to source, soil.**

#### *The Return; a journey through the alchemy of soil.*

**A movable feast; plant knowledge distilled and assimilated through the physical body, cultivated into living soil, and returned to the womb of Mother Earth *in-kind.* Sustenance; life supporting and sustaining. Returned as something meaningful.**

#### *Direct contact with the divine made manifest.*

***A symbiotic microbial messenger; from humus, through human, to humus. Returned to a different local with a unique healing microbial make up. Healing Wo-man, their relationships with one another and Mother Earth through the unified soil womb.***

#### *Empowering direct experience.* What ever the physical mind feeds upon is what the *Earth Body* calls to *Wo-Man*, *Soil too Soul* they receive.

**As such this journey will begin in a field,** the soils cultivated by the [Nam Khan Eco Lodge and Farm,](https://www.namkhanecolodge.com/) chosen for the close proximity and open access. The Nam Khan River is a major tributary of the river Mekong, with which it joins at Luang Prabang. A journey 6.5km up river to harvest soil knowledge at the source, and document cultivation from seed to harvest. The journey will then continue into the home kitchen, sharing recipes of soul food for the physical body. Moving through the body into the fermentation chamber, following the dynamic alchemical return to source, cultivating microbial soil, soul food for the earth body.

***To reveal a path toward healing the rift that grows between Wo-Man and nature.***

Bring the body back into conversation with all that is green and growing. A universe that never stopped speaking to Wo-man, even when they forgot how to listen.
