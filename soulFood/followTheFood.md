# From Soil To Plate To Soil

## The *Life - Death - Life* Cycle Of Soul Food.

### *To whence it comes from, to wherein its going, and to whither it will become.*

#### Nature creates conditions for life, she can't force it and she can't fake it. Things must undergo the formality of actually occurring. Its the soil and plants as part of a symbiotic partnership that make soul food plausible.

#### Woman is A Religion of; The redemption of Earth through magic. To act, and that act to transfer through the healing microbial soil, the Womb of Mother Earth.

***Its not that nature is alive its that its intelligent. The felt experience of being in organism; standing as a mirror before nature as its object. Its not to see life, its to recognize it when its seen. Woman is nature and as such, can speak for Mother Earth.***

#### *This will document the alchemical journey of *Soul Food,* from its soil source, cultivation, harvest, preservation/preparation to culinary delight, and its multi dimensional return back to source, soil.*

**The Return: The journey through alchemy *in-kind,* the redemption of earth through magic. To be indigenous to a land means caring for it's next generations use.**

#### *Alchemy of soil;* Plant knowledge distilled through the physical body, cultivated into living soil, and returned to the womb of Mother Earth *in-kind.* Returned as something useful. A microbial messenger; from humus to human to humus. Returned, to a different local with a unique healing microbial make up. Contact with the divine made into matter, healing Wo-mans relationship with Mother Earth through the soil.

**This journey will begin, in a field,** the soils of the [Nam Khan Eco Lodge and Farm,](https://www.namkhanecolodge.com/) chosen for its proximity and ease of access. The Nam Khan River is a major tributary of the river Mekong, with which it joins at Luang Prabang. A journey 6.5km up river to harvest soil knowledge at the source, and document cultivation from seed to harvest. The journey will then continue through to home kitchen and its microbial return.

#### *Empowering direct experience.* What ever the physical mind feeds upon is what the *earth body* calls to Wo-Man, soil too soul they receive.
