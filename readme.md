### *The Ecology Is The Economy.*

#### *Conservation as a consequence of lifestyle/production.*

**Projecting ones lifestyle into a future possibility, living the creative process, and designing a living that feeds the Soul and honors the Soil, that pays the Bills.**

#### *Examining ecologic behaviors.*
***Loss of biodiversity is directly related to the lifestyles of human beings.***

**It's time to start comparing consumption and lifestyle, and checking this against nature's ability to provide for this consumption. Humans have destroyed and continue to destroy the habitats of species on a daily basis. It's time to own up to the realities of what that translates to for the generations to come, aesthetically and otherwise. It's time to be *Ecologically Realistic* and get back to the *heart* of what *life* is all about.** 

**This is about honesty and responsibility. Honesty; admitting to what is. Responsibility; not blaming anybody else.**

## Environ-Mental Health ~ *The ethics of ecology; Learning to live in the light of Nature.*

### *The cultivation of a more attuned and responsive awareness of Wo-Mans ecological interconnections.*

#### *Loss of biodiversity is catastrophic, impacts are symbiotic and happen within the physical body and Mother Earth, far into future generations.*

**Having accepted this circumstance *responsibility* then means *ability,* to have a *creative response* to the situation as it is *now.* The *seeds of opportunity* and awareness, to take the moment and transform it into a better situation.** 

#### An opportunity for the creation of something new and beautiful. 

**Todayâ€™s young generation are being handed the biggest challenge of all; *'Cultivating Biodiversity'* the symbiotic living *'Quality of Life'* on this planet.**

**Not addressing immediate needs is an insult to the young. People with passion, purpose and practical skills make the world a better place.** 

#### *Its time to act on the environ-mental realities, soil to soul cultivate cultures that heal.*

### *Cooperation and Harmony ~ Soil Seekers and Vivarium Salon Circle/Programs*

#### *Dynamic Governance Values*
- Effectiveness: Get things done
- Transparency: Open - Everyone knows
- Equivalence: Fairness/ equality

#### *Governing Principles*
- Consent decision making : decisions are made by consent not consensus.

- Circle organization : semi-autonomous self-governing groups, each of which has its own goals, and the responsibility to direct, operate and measure its own processes.

- Double Linking : An appointed representative of each working group (circle) participates with equal power in the governing group (circle) that oversees and supports the decision making processes and initiatives. Likewise an elected operational leader from the governing group (circle) participates in the working group. The governing group also sends an appointed representative to a higher level governing group, if one exists, and accepts an operational leader elected by that governing group as well.

#### Key Benefits
- Fast equivalent decision making process
- Objections are welcome and inform and evolve proposals
- Objections are validated in relation to the vision and shared aims
- Power is given to reason
- Roles are elected, not volunteered
- Full proposals are brought to meetings and are: Solution based (every problem comes with at least 3 solutions) AND- All decisions are time bound and reevaluated

#### Challenges
- Requires training of all participants to be effective
- Requires efficient and timely communication and facilitation
