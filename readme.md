**A new Eco Conscious breed of WoMan has evolved from the adage of "The American Dream", the wild places of this world need WoMan to do better than that.**

**It's Time to start comparing consumption and lifestyles, and checking this against nature's ability to provide for this consumption. It's Time to own up to the realities of what that translates to for the generations to come. It's time to be Ecologically Realistic and get back to the heart of what Life is all about.** 

#### *EnvironMental Health*

**The loss of biodiversity on the planet is directly related to the behaviours of human beings. Humans have destroyed and continue to destroy the habitats of species on a daily basis. The catastrophic impact of loss of biodiversity (The Sixth Extinction) will affect the planet and its inhabitants for generations to come.** 

**Having accepted this circumstance, responsibility then means the *ability* to have a creative response to the situation as it is Now. The *seeds of opportunity*, and awareness to take the moment and transform it into a better situation.**

**Not addressing immediate needs is an insult to the young. People with passion, purpose and practical skills make the world a better place. Its time to Act on the environMental realities they face.**

### Cooperation and Harmony

#### SOCIOCRACY AND DYNAMIC GOVERNANCE VALUES
- Effectiveness: Get things done
- Transparency: Open - Everyone knows
- Equivalence: Fairness/ equality

#### GOVERNING PRINCIPLES
- Consent decision making : decisions are made by consent not consensus.

- Circle organization : semi-autonomous self-governing groups, each of which has its owngoals, and the responsibility to direct, operate and measure its own processes.

- Double Linking : An appointed representative of each working group (circle) participates with equal power in the governing group (circle) that oversees and supports the decision making processes and initiatives. Likewise an elected operational leader from the governing group (circle) participates in the working group. The governing group also sends an appointed representative to a higher level governing group, if one exists, and accepts an operational leader elected by that governing group as well.

#### KEY BENEFITS
- Fast equivalent decision making process
- Objections are welcome and inform and evolve proposals
- Objections are validated in relation to the vision and shared aims
- Power is given to reason
- Roles are elected, not volunteered
- Full proposals are brought to meetings and are: Solution based (every problem comes with at least 3 solutions) AND- All decisions are time bound and reevaluated

#### CHALLENGES
- Requires training of all participants to be effective
- Requires efficient and timely communication and facilitation
