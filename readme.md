**Projecting ones lifestyle into a future possibility, living the creative process, and designing a living that feeds the Soul and honors the Soil, that pays the Bills.**

**Examining ecologic behaviors.**

*Loss of biodiversity is directly related to the lifestyles of human beings.*

*It's time to start comparing consumption and lifestyle, and checking this against nature's ability to provide for this consumption. Humans have destroyed and continue to destroy the habitats of species on a daily basis. It's time to own up to the realities of what that translates to for the generations to come, aesthetically and otherwise. It's time to be *Ecologically Realistic* and get back to the *heart* of what *life* is all about.* 

**This is about honesty and responsibility. Honesty; admitting to what is. Responsibility; not blaming someone else.**

#### *Quality Of Life*

Loss of biodiversity and ecosystems are catastrophic, impacts are symbiotic and happen within the physical body through too *Mother Earth,* far into future generations.

Being responsible stewards of the Earth means taking to heart the current planetary healing crisis.
