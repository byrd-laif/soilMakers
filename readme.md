### Life*Styles* For Change ~ Becoming a part of the circle of life.

### *Salon Circle;* A renewed culture of Artful Conversation, honoring personal intention within group process to create egalitarian forums.

**At a time of ecological and economic precarity, *salon style* "wisdom/council circle", offer space for rethinking and remaking symbiotic relations with one-self, one-another and Mother Earth.**

### *Salon Programs;* Designed to be Fun, Creative, Interactive and Resourceful.

**To awaken possibility and creative insight, refine the taste, and increase the knowledge of the participants through guided conversation organized around cultures and ideas reflective of the era in which they live.**

***Harvesting Knowledge** to design a more desirable, fulfilling, life supporting; Ecologically Modern and Realistic Lifestyle.*

*An integrated set of processes that allow the often hidden insight of human expertise to be captured and converted into specific actionable know-how that can be transferred to others.*

### *The Ecology Is The Economy.*

#### *Conservation as a consequence of lifestyle/production.*

**Projecting ones lifestyle into a future possibility, living the creative process, and designing a living that feeds the Soul and honors the Soil, that pays the Bills.**

#### *Examining ecologic behaviors.*

***Loss of biodiversity is directly related to the lifestyles of human beings.***

*It's time to start comparing consumption and lifestyle, and checking this against nature's ability to provide for this consumption. Humans have destroyed and continue to destroy the habitats of species on a daily basis. It's time to own up to the realities of what that translates to for the generations to come, aesthetically and otherwise. It's time to be *Ecologically Realistic* and get back to the *heart* of what *life* is all about.* 

**This is about honesty and responsibility. Honesty; admitting to what is. Responsibility; not blaming anybody else.**

# *Soil Sisters ~ Eco-logical Movement And Enterprise*

## Cultivating an *Eco-logical Economy* creates the market for an *Economically Sustainable* future.

### *A bio-logical movement, a 'symbiotic legacy venture' with Mother Earth. A system that operates to deliver positive ecological impact and by that symbiotically profit through seeding the soil, the Womb of Mother Earth.*

#### *Cultivating The Mother Tree;* An archaic revival of Wo-Mans Gaian connection through honoring the feminine. Soil Sisters relate to Mother Earth, Gaia as *'The Live And Dynamic Co-evolutionary Partner'* in the shaping of the set, setting and the process.

***Creating co-Evolutionary Leaders;*** Revolutionary Eco-logical actions that are transferable through to nature. ***Bio-Logical Earth Care*** provides the environment for an ecologically and economically sustainable future. Production (profit) can then become the consequence of conservation.

A radical sift from the 'dominator'; biological warfare built on guilt, fear and force. To an 'ecological partnership'; Bio-Logical Freedom, free to swim in the rivers of Mother Earth without fear of reprisal.

Partnership system supports mutually respectful and caring relations. Reconciliation, free to turn and question: Where does Wo-Man go from here?

**Environ-Mental Health ~ *The ethics of ecology;* Learning to live in the light of Nature.**

**The cultivation of a more attuned and responsive awareness of Wo-Mans ecological interconnections. Ones dream and the dream of the planet As One.**

***Connecting with things that make living possible.*** Being attracted to all that is alive and vital, the human tendency to relate with life and natural processes - *Is The Expression Of A Biological Need.*

### *Quality Of Life* - Loss of biodiversity and ecosystems is catastrophic, impacts are symbiotic and happen within the physical body and Mother Earth, far into future generations.

**Being responsible stewards of the Earth means taking to heart the current planetary healing crisis. Having accepted this circumstance *responsibility* then means *ability,* to have a *creative response* to the situation as it is *now.* The *seeds of opportunity* and awareness, to take the moment and transform it into a better situation.**

#### An opportunity for the creation of something new and beautiful.

**Putting nature on the balance sheet. Bio-Logical Eco system services; Transforming an Environ-mental withdraw to an Environ-mental Deposit for the future.**

**Todayâ€™s young generation are being handed the biggest challenge of all; *'Cultivating Biodiversity'* the symbiotic living *'Fabric of Life'* of this planet.**

**Not addressing immediate needs is an insult to the young. People with passion, purpose and practical skills make the world a better place.** 

#### *It's time to call home. To act and that act to transfer through nature, soil to soul cultivate cultures that heal.*
