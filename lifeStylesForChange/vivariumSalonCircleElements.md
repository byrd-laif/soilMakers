### Basic Guidelines for Calling a Vivarium Salon Circle

These guidelines are an adapted excerpted from the book: Calling the Circle, the First and Future Culture by Christina Baldwin in addition to the ongoing work of PeerSpirit, Inc.

Now more than ever, the circle may serve Wo-Man as a form that honors all voices and invites wisdom into their midst. The circle offers the human community a safe interpersonal gathering point inside which members may courageously listen to one another, speak truths, and act with clear intention.

#### *Wisdom or Council Circle is a world wide gift.*

The 'circle', or council methodology is an ancient social structure that has gathered human beings into respectful conversation for thousands of years. Serving as the foundation for collaborative dialogue and action in many cultures. Circle is used as a space to be social, to discover safe methods of dialogue, to share stories, build community, and hold meetings in a collaborative manner. In some areas of the world this tradition remains intact, but in other societies it has been nearly forgotten.

Vivarium Salon Circle is a modern methodology that calls on this tradition and helps people gather in conversations that fulfill their potential for dialogue, replenishment, and wisdom-based ecological change. Soil Seekers form a partnership with Vivarium Salon Circle, dedicated to a global ecological shift through conversation. Circle enables one to discover the collective wisdom. It helps participants discover who they are in relation to one another and their environments, as well as the resources each can offer to the conversation and conservation tasks at hand.

The circle as a global experience has the ability to remind people of common human values, ethics and ecological concerns.

**The circle offers the process** (the way of being together in conversation) and the intention of the group offers the content, nature provides the opportunity.

***Each circle experience can be different.***
Circle may have similar rituals of opening and closing, but very different content. While other circle may share similar content with very different rituals.

Whatever the setting, what makes a meeting into a circle is the willingness of people to shift from informal socializing or opinionated discussion into a receptive attitude of thoughtful speaking and deep listening often referred to as "the sacred space of council."

Though expressed in slightly different ways in different cultures and through different methodologies, the sacred space of council consists of a structure that takes conversation to its depths.

#### *Calling the circle:*

***The role of the host***

To start a circle, somebody needs to set an intention (content, mission, or direction), offer basic structure, and be ready to model circle skills while others become accustomed to how a circle works. This person is the caller of the circle, sometimes called the circle host. A circle may be held one time or meet many times over a period of months or years. In ongoing circles, the host role can rotate so that responsibility for the group is shared among members.

***The components of the circle***

- Welcome Start-point
- Center and Check-in/Greeting
- Agreements
- Intention
- Three Principles and Three Practices
- Guardian of process
- Check-out and Farewell

***Intention***

Intention shapes the circle and determines who will come, how long the circle will meet, and what kinds of outcomes are to be expected. The caller of the circle needs to articulate an intention that will invite people to the first meeting. Intention may evolve as the circle gathers, but it is very helpful to have an idea that will attract the people the circle needs.

***Welcome or Start-point***

Once people have gathered, it is helpful for the host, or any volunteer participant, to begin the circle with a gesture that shifts people's attention from social space to council space. This gesture of welcome may be a moment of silence, reading a poem, singing a song, or listening to a musical interlude, whatever invites a sense of calm presence.

***Establishing the center***

The center of a circle is like the hub of a wheel: all energies pass through it, and it holds the rim together. To help people remember how the hub helps the group, the *center* of a circle usually holds object/s that represent the intention of the circle. Any symbol that fits this purpose or adds beauty will serve: flowers, a bowl or basket, a candle. Choose something fairly simple that suits the environment, honors local ecological culture, or symbolically represents group intention.

***Check-in/Greeting***

Check-in helps people into a frame of mind for council and reminds everyone of their commitment to the expressed intention. It insures that people are truly present in mind as well as in body.

Crafting questions is an art form. The choice of an opening question for check-in is a significant piece of preparation for a host calling a salon circle the first time, and every time. The question is like a flower that beckons to the bee, and the responses pollinate the ensuing conversation.

To check-in with a new circle, people may say their names and offer a brief self-introduction. To check-in with an ongoing circle, people may speak briefly about their hopes for the meeting, offer other social comment, or share anecdotal stories about their lives.

Some circles enjoy the tradition of having each person share an object that represents him or herself in the meeting. As each person contributes an object (or a thought) to 'center'(metaphorically or literally) he/she may tell a brief story about what the object represents and what it means to bring it.

Check-in usually starts with a volunteer and proceeds around the circle. If an individual is not ready to speak, the turn is passed and another opportunity is offered after others have completed their check-ins.

***Setting circle agreements:***

The use of agreements creates an interpersonal container that allows all members to have a free and profound exchange, to respect a diversity of views, and to share responsibility of the well-being and direction of the group.

***Agreements often used as a basis in Vivarium Salon Circles include:***

- To hold stories or personal material in confidentiality and honor other material, information or decisions with a level of confidentiality appropriate to the setting.

- Listen to each other with compassion and curiosity.

- Ask for what is needed and offer what one can.

- Agree to employ a group guardian to watch the need, timing, and energy. 

- Agree to pause at a signal, and to call for that signal when one feels the need to pause. 

This signal may be a chime, bell or rattle, at which sound all action stops, people recenter, the guardian signals again and speaks to the need he/she felt in the group. 

Each ongoing circle will consider their agreements and spend time phrasing them in their own words and adding agreements that suit their purpose together.

***Three principles:***
The circle is not a leaderless group, it is an all leader group. The structure created by components of the circle becomes a form of self-governance.

Three principles referenced in wisdom/council circle work serve as a foundation for this governance. 

These principles are:

- Leadership can rotate among all circle members.
- Responsibility is shared for the quality of experience.
- Members place ultimate reliance on inspiration (or spirit), rather than on any personal agenda.

***Three practices:***

The primary activity of circle is the interaction of speaking and listening.

Three practices of council remind members of the quality of attention that council space invites us:

- To speak with intention: noting what has relevance to the conversation in the moment.

- To listen with attention: respectful of the learning process all members of the group.

- To tend the well-being of the circle: remaining aware of the impact of ones contributions.

***Forms of council:***

The circle commonly uses three forms of council: talking piece, conversation and reflection.

Talking piece council is often used as part of check-in, check-out, and whenever there is a desire to slow down the conversation, collect all voices and contributions, and be able to speak without interruption. Talking piece council is described in detail below.

Conversation council is often used when what is needed is a reaction, interaction, and an interjection of new ideas, thoughts and opinions. The energy of open conversation stimulates the free flow of ideas. However, in circle, the agreement to pause and gather thoughts can be very helpful in the midst of conversation council. Attention should be paid to pacing so that all contributions are honored.

Reflection, or Silent council gives each member time and space to reflect on what is occurring, or needs to occur, in the course of a meeting. Silence may be called so that each person can consider the role or impact they are having on the group, or to help the group realign with the intention, or to sit with a question until there is clarity. Depending on the setting and purpose of the circle, members may ask for a period of group silence as way to wait for guidance, take time-out from conversation, or center one-self more deeply before making a decision or taking action.

***Guardian***

The single most important tool for aiding self-governance and bringing the circle back to intention is the role of the guardian. To provide a guardian, one circle member at a time volunteers to watch and safeguard group energy and observe the circle process. The guardian has the group's permission to intercede in group process for the purpose of calling the circle back to center, to focus on the issue or topic, to remind members of respectful practices or agreements, or to suggest a rest break.

The guardian usually employs a gentle noise-maker, such as a chime, bell, or rattle, that signals members to stop action, take a breath, rest in a space of silence. Then the guardian makes this signal again and speaks to why he/she called the pause.

The guardian may suggest use of the talking piece, if the conversation has become hurried, jumbled or unproductive. The guardian may call for time out or a rest break as needed, watch timeliness, and help members see conflict arising and face it creatively. It should be noted that anyone can call for a time-out, or ask for the talking piece, but the guardian should be especially looking for these opportunities.

***Talking Piece***

The talking piece can be any object, literal or metaphorical that can be easily *passed.* This may be an object from Nature, such as a stone, stick or feather, or an object that has meaning for a particular circle. When employed in a round of council, only the person *holding* the talking piece speaks, and other circle members listen without interruption.

A talking piece is used whenever there is a desire to move the conversation more slowly so everyone's stories, input or wisdom can be gathered. One member picks up or requests the talking piece, shares his/her thoughts, or story and then passes it on. The talking piece progresses around the circle, either in sequence or by volunteering, until everyone has had an opportunity to contribute. As in check-in, one may pass a turn and then speak after others have spoken.

***Checkout and Farewell***

At the close of a circle meeting, it is important to allow a few minutes for each member to comment on what they learned, or what stays in their heart and mind as they leave.

Closing the circle by checking out provides a formal end to the meeting, a chance for members to reflect on anything that has transpired.

As participants shift from council space to social space or private time, each release one another from the intensity of attention being in circle requires. Often after check-out, the host, guardian, or volunteer will offer a few inspirational words or farewell, or signal a few seconds of silence before the circle is released.

Circle is not a dogmatic form. Each circle will develop its own unique personality and style. The circle structure has proven its strength and adaptability from the first campfires of ancestors to the global age. Each circle contributes to this long-held human tradition through the practices of listening, speaking, and thoughtful action.
