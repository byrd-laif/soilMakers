# *The Soil Rehabilitation Magic of Bokashi*

## *A Revival Of The Gian Connection; a journey of healing the Soil too heal the Soul.*

**Life is not possible without Rich Fertile Soil.**

***Soil Alchemy*** is the ongoing exploration of what happens when people connect head, heart, and body in the crucible of the soil. The ancient alchemists combined substances and used the influence of their own minds to study the transmutation of matter and of spirit. Observe when the discursive mind becomes quieter and the intelligence of the heart comes to the foreground, a new ecologically symbiotic consciousness emerges. Work in symbiotic partnership with the more-than-human world and make incredible discoveries. 

### *Soil Therapy;* the practice of spending time *Cultivating Fertile Soil* for the purpose of Enhancing Whole Health, Earth Care, Wellness, and Happiness. A practice of *Symbiotic Connection* with the natural world and with each other, healing soil to soul.

A series of guided invitations, natural cycles, bring one into the present moment, opening the doors of symbiotic communication with the soil, waters, and landscapes they explore. Encounter not just the soil, but the many ways nature mirrors humans, encountering ourselves, Soil to Soul Food.

#### **What is Bokashi?**

**Pro-biotic Soul Food For The Soil.**
Bokashi is a Japanese term meaning fermented organic matter and refers to a 2-step method of indoor composting that uses beneficial micro-organisms to quickly ferment many types of organic matter including food remnants, fruit, vegetables, meat, dairy and bread.

#### *Method*

**Step 1: Fermentation** - takes place indoors in a Bokashi bin.
Layering food remnants with a starter mix, the microbes present in the starter mix quickly ferment the food remnants. Once filled set the bin aside for 10 - 14 days and start using another bin. Two weeks later the initial bin of organic matter will be fully fermented and ready for Step 2.

Although the terms humus and compost are informally used interchangeably, they are distinct soil components with different origins; humus is created through anaerobic fermentation, while compost is the result of aerobic decomposition.

**Step 2: Decomposition** - is done in the garden, compost pile, or a semi closed pro-biotic *soil factory*. Shallow bury the contents of the bin in the garden or compost bin. Up to 1/3 can be added to the bottom of indoor or outdoor pots.

Most food remnants will be indistinguishable from the soil in a week or two, although certain items like bones, egg shells, and corn cobs will take longer to disappear and will act as a slow release fertilizer. While the organic matter is decomposing it is still quite acidic so wait 10 days before planting.

The active ingredients in the process are the effective microorganisms â€“ a combination of lactic acid bacteria (also found in home kefir whey and lacto ferments), photosynthetic bacteria, and yeast - that ferment the organic matter. These microbes, present in the Bokashi Starter Mix, are sprinkled over the layers of food remnants as the bin is filled.

A healthy Bokashi bucket does not create bad odors, greenhouse gas, or heat - uses no power, and is completely natural. The aroma of the open bin is slightly sweet, fermented (sour), perhaps slightly alcoholic odor and should not be offensive.

#### *Benefits of Bokashi*
**A solution to some very big problems.**
**Ecologically Responsible management of organic kitchen remnants can reduce 70% of the total waste production and reduce the bad gases produced during organic decomposition, while saving the environment by creating bio-active soil and pro-biotic fertilizer to combat the negative use of toxic chemicals and pollutants.**

#### *Conservation as a consequence of production.*
Bokashi, the ecologically responsible option for food remnants of those living in apartments/condos or for those looking to use their food remnants as a nutrient rich pro-biotic soil amendment in their garden, plant pots or the environment as a gift of thanks, fertile soil for Mother Earth. No traditional garden is required! Be creative. Whats around ...

**Bokashi can be:**

- fairly easy to maintain
- very affordable
- can use most food remnants (including meat, dairy and cooked foods)
- provides a nutrient rich pro-biotic soil amendment and liquid fertilizer for house plants, the garden, or potted plants.

#### *Materials and Tools Needed*

- A minimum of two 5-gallon nesting buckets with tight fitting lids (three is best to have a rotation)
- Absorbent material (peat moss, coconut coir, shredded newspaper, sawdust, dried small leaf or grass...)
- Bokashi starter mix
- Food remnants chopped into small pieces
- drill or soldering iron
- clay building brick or same size rock

#### *Setting up The Bokashi Buckets*

- On the bottom of one bucket, drill or melt with a soldering iron, 20 to 30 holes with a 1/8- to 1/4-inch drill bit.
- Place brick or rock in the bucket with no holes.
- Set the bucket with holes into the solid bucket, with no holes.
- Cover the bucket with a tight-fitting lid.
- Start adding food remnants and bokashi inoculant, Starter Mix to the bucket.
- Harvest liquid fertilizer (bokashi tea) by lifting the top bucket off of the bottom bucket, pouring any liquid into a separate container. Observe on a regular basis.

Note: The brick creates space for the liquid fertilizer to collect and to ensure the buckets do not get stuck together as the inner bucket fills. 

#### *Making Bokashi Bran / Starter Mix*

**Molasses : EM/Serum : Warm water(pure) : Absorbent material**

EM means effective micro-organisms. EM is a laboratory cultured mixture of naturally occurring micro-organisms consisting mainly of lactic acid bacteria, photosynthetic bacteria (purple bacteria) and yeasts which co-exist for the benefit of whichever environment they are introduced. EM can be purchased or easily cultured in house with readily available ingredients (instructions provided below). 

Molasses have several uses beyond that of a straightforward food additive. It can be used as the **base material for
fermentation** into rum and as the carbon source for in situ remediation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. It can be used as a chelating agent to remove rust where a rusted part stays a few weeks in a mixture of 1 part molasses and 10 parts water.

**50ml molasses : 50ml EM/Serum : 250-300ml water : 5kg absorbent material**

- Combine all liquids starting with 250ml of warm water.

- Pour over the absorbent material so that when squeezed together some of it holds but no liquid comes out. Add more water if needed.

- Seal in a bag or use a bucket and put a bag over it and then a lid, NO Air or as little as possible. Seal and ferment for 10 - 14 days.

- Sniff test, the bokashi should smell a little like apple cider vinegar. Its ready to use! For long term storage, lay the fermented sawdust out on shallow trays and dry in the shade. Once dry it can be stored in containers.

*Voila "Bokashi Bran"*

#### *Making Serum = E/M*

**1) Rice Water**

- To Make Rice Water:

- 1:2 rice to water ratio, soak rice for about 15 minutes, stir vigorously then strain and ferment the water in a open air vessel with a secured cloth cover to allow exposure to the air for 5 - 8 days. (rice can be cooked and consumed)

**2) Home ferment Kefir whey or sauerkraut juice**

Kefir Whey made available from straining kefir milk through cloth to separate the milk solids from the liquid whey. If not available then add 1 part fermented rice water to 10 parts whole milk, cover and allow to ferment 10 - 14 days. The ferment will separate into three distinct layers. Use a turkey baster or some such device to retrieve the middle layer.

**Next combine:**

**1 part rice water : 10 parts Kefir Whey or sauerkraut juice**

- Bottle, cap and store in a cool dark place.

- For long storage of bokashi serum add a little molasses.

#### *Inside the Bokashi Bucket*

- Assemble your buckets and start adding food remnants, compact with a potato masher or use the bottom of a cup.

- Once the bin is about 1/2 inch of compacted food remnants dust with the bokashi starter.

- Repeat until the bin is full.

Once full seal and set aside in a warm dark corner to ferment for 2 weeks.

Bury in the garden, add to a compost bin or use in pots (up to 1/3 by volume).

#### *Bokashi Tea*

The liquid or Bokashi Tea that collects during the process must be removed on a regular basis. Bokashi tea contains nutrients from the fermented food remnants, alive with micro-organisms, a rich fertilizer.

Bokashi tea has millions of microbes, an incredibly beneficial soil enhancer. Accelerate decomposition in compost piles, pour directly into compost. The beneficial bacteria help to speed up the composting process. Adding bokashi tea is a great way to add moisture to the compost pile, if needed. Use fresh bokashi tea for best results.

Watering the garden... Bokashi tea is strong and must be diluted with water at a 100:1 ratio, 100 parts water to 1 part bokashi tea, approximately 2 teaspoons of tea for every liter of water.

If the bokashi tea can not be used straight away, simply poor it down the drain. It is completely natural and will not pollute. The bokashi bacteria  help to unblock clogged drains and are beneficial to the water. Bokashi tea contributes to cleaning up waterways as the good bacteria compete with the bad bacteria.

Pour the concentrated Bokashi tea directly into kitchen and bathroom drains, toilets and septic systems. It will help prevent algae build-up and control odor.
