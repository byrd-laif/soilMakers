### Basic Guidelines for Calling a Soil Makers *Salon Circle*
*Honoring the lineage of the circle and PeerSpirit methodology as one uses this gift. (http://www.peerspirit.com)*

These guidelines are an adapted excerpted from the book: Calling the Circle, the First and Future Culture by Christina Baldwin in addition to the ongoing work of PeerSpirit, Inc.

Now more than ever, the circle may serve humanity as a form that honors all voices, inviting wisdom into their midst. Offering the human community a safe interpersonal gathering point inside which members and participants may courageously listen to one another, speak truths, and act with clear intention.

#### *Wisdom or Council Circle is a world wide gift.*

The *'circle'*, or council methodology is an *ancient social structure* that has gathered human beings into respectful conversation for thousands of years. Serving as the foundation for *collaborative dialogue and action* in many cultures. Circle is used as a space to be social; discovering safe methods of dialogue, sharing stories, building community, and holding meetings in a collaborative manner.

Soil Makers *Salon Circle* is a modern methodology that calls on this tradition, helping participants gather in conversations that fulfills ones potential for dialogue, replenishment, and wisdom-based environMental changes. Soil Makers form a partnership through Salon Circle, dedicated to a global environMental shift through conversation. *Circle* enables participants to discover the collective wisdom. Helping to feel where one is, in relation to one another and their environments, as well as the resources each can offer to the conversation or task at hand.

The circle as a global experience has the ability of reminding someone of common human values, ethics and ecological concerns. Encouraging a focus on the *issue at hand* council circle minimizes the tendency for discussion to fall into a debate between participants.

**The circle offers the process** (the way of being together in conversation) and the intention of the group offers the content, nature provides the opportunity.

***Each salon circle experience can be different.***
Circle may have similar rituals of opening and closing, but very different content. While other circle may share similar content with very different rituals.

**Whatever the setting, what makes a meeting into a circle is the willingness of the host and participants to shift from informal socializing or opinionated discussion into a receptive attitude of thoughtful speaking and deep listening often referred to as "the sacred space of council."**

Though expressed in slightly different ways in different cultures and through different methodologies, the sacred space of council consists of a structure that takes conversation to its depths.

#### *Calling the circle:*

***The role of the host***

- Being modest and humble about what can be accomplished.

- Allowing space for all voices, stressing that although the host will try, each opinion may not be heard.

**The Beginning**

To start a circle, somebody needs to set an intention (content, mission, or direction), offering a basic structure, being ready to model circle skills while others become accustomed to how a circle works. This person is the caller of the circle, sometimes called the circle host. A circle may be held one time or meet many times over a period of months or years. In ongoing circles, the host role can rotate so that responsibility for the group is shared among members.

**Intentions**

The host briefly shares the nature of the dialog and explains the ground rules. This is a sharing of experience, not a discussion; avoid analysis and theorizing, respecting what all share, refraining from making judgments. There is no probing or cross-questioning one another; aiming to answer with complete honesty and freedom, feeling free to not answer a given question. The host begins, and then the conversation continues in flow, so that all feel they have a proper space in which to participate.

Intentions shape the circle and determines whom will attend, how long the circle will meet, and what kinds of outcomes are to be expected. The host/caller of the circle articulates an intention, inviting individuals to the first meeting. Intentions may evolve as the circle gathers, but it is very helpful to have an idea that will attract those individuals the circle needs. Expecting nothing; being ready for anything. Having goals, while deferring to the greater wisdom.

On-line or in person-  Setting the intention pr-gathering with materials. 

*Including an inspirational quote or image so that the discussion begins in a reflective way, even before the circle.

#### *The components of the circle*

- Welcoming Starting-point
- Clarifying Agreements
- Centering and Checking-in/Greeting
- Sharing Intentions
- Three Principles and Three Practices
- Guardian of process
- Checking-out and Farewell


***Welcome or Start-point***

Once participants have gathered, it is helpful for the host, or any volunteer participant, to begin the circle with a gesture that shifts people's attention from social space to council space. This gesture of welcoming may be a moment of silence, reading a poem, singing a song, or listening to a musical interlude, whatever invites a sense of calm presence and brings everyone into the space together. 

***Establishing the center***

The center of a circle is like the hub of a wheel: all energies pass through it, and it holds the rim together. To help participants remember how the hub helps the group, the *center* of a circle usually holds object/s that represent the intention of the circle. Any *symbol* that fits this purpose or adds beauty will serve: flowers, a bowl or basket, a candle. Choose something fairly simple that suits the environment, honors local ecological culture, or symbolically represents group intention.

***Checking-in/Greeting*** 

Checking-in helps participants into the *wisdom/council* frame of mind and reminds everyone of their commitment to the expressed intention. Insuring that participants are truly present in mind as well as in body, and for on-line gatherings, becomes easier to imagine each other in the circle.

Crafting questions is an art form. The choice of an opening question for checking-in is a significant piece of preparation for a host calling a salon circle the first time, and every time. The question is like a flower that beckons to the bee, and the responses pollinate the ensuing conversation.

Checking-in with a new circle, participants may share  ones name and/or offer a brief self-introduction. Checking-in with an ongoing circle, participants may speak briefly about the purpose for attending the meeting, offer other social comment, or share anecdotal stories about their lives.

Some circles enjoy the tradition of having each participant share an object that represents him or herself in the meeting. As each one contributes an object (or a thought) to 'center'(metaphorically or literally) optionally telling a brief story about what the object represents and what it means to bring it.

Checking-in usually starts with a volunteer and proceeds around the circle. If a participant is not ready to speak, the turn is passed and another opportunity is offered after others have completed.

#### **Setting circle agreements:*

The use of agreements creates an interpersonal container that allows all members, hosts and participants to have a free and profound exchange, respecting a diversity of views, and sharing responsibility of the well-being and direction of the group.

#### *Agreements used as a basis in Vivarium Salon/Circle include:*

- Holding stories or personal material in confidentiality and honor other material, information or decisions with a level of confidentiality appropriate to the setting.

- Speaking and sharing should be from feeling and experience, rather than from theory or opinion.

- Listening to each other with compassion and curiosity. Without judgment, **listening to understand, not to agree with or believe.**
 
- Exercising empathy and generosity. Asking for what is needed and offering what one can. **Being kind; assuming the best. (There are so many possibilities for misunderstanding.)**

- Agreeing to employ a group guardian for watching over the needs, timing, and energy. 

- Agreeing to pause at a signal, calling for that signal when one feels the need to pause. 

This signal may be a chime, bell or rattle, at which sound all action stops, participants recenter, the guardian signals again and speaks to the need he/she felt in the group. 

Each ongoing circle considers their agreements and spends time phrasing them in their own words, adding agreements that suit their purpose together.

#### *Three principles.*

The circle is not a leaderless group, it is an all leader group. The structure created by components of the circle becomes a form of self-governance.

Three principles referenced in wisdom/council circle work serve as a foundation for this governance. 

**These principles are:**

- Leadership can rotate among all circle members.
- Responsibility is shared for the quality of experience.
- Members place ultimate reliance on inspiration (or spirit), rather than on any personal agenda.

#### *Three practices.*

The primary activity of circle is the interaction of speaking and listening.

Three practices of council remind members of the quality of attention that council space invites us.

**These practices are:**

- Speaking with intention: noting what has relevance to the conversation in the moment.

- Listening with attention: respectful of the learning process of the group as a whole.

- Tending the well-being of the circle: remaining aware of the impact of ones contributions.

#### *Three forms of council.*

The circle commonly uses three forms of council: talking piece, conversation and reflection.

**Talking piece** council is often used as part of checking-in, checking-out, and whenever there is a desire to slow down the conversation, collect all voices and contributions, and be able to speak without interruption. Talking piece council is described in detail below.

**Conversation council** is often used when what is needed is a reaction, interaction, and an interjection of new ideas, thoughts and opinions. The energy of open conversation stimulates the free flow of ideas. However, in circle, the agreement to pause and gather thoughts can be very helpful in the midst of conversation council. Attention should be paid to pacing so that all contributions are honored.

**Reflection, or Silent council** gives each member time and space to reflect on what is occurring, or needs to occur, in the course of a meeting. Silence may be called so that each person can consider the role or impact they are having on the group, or to help the group realign with the intention, or to sit with a question until there is clarity. Depending on the setting and purpose of the circle, members may ask for a period of group silence as way to wait for guidance, take time-out from conversation, or center one-self more deeply before making a decision or taking action.

#### *Guardians*

The single most important tool for aiding self-governance and bringing the circle back to intention is the role of the guardian. To provide a guardian, one circle member at a time volunteers to watch and safeguard group energy and observe the circle process. The guardian has the group's permission to intercede in group process for the purpose of calling the circle back to center, to focus on the issue or topic, to remind members of respectful practices or agreements, or to suggest a rest break.

The guardian usually employs a gentle noise-maker, such as a chime, bell, or rattle, that signals members to stop action, take a breath, rest in a space of silence. Then the guardian makes this signal again and speaks to why he/she called the pause.

The guardian may suggest use of the talking piece, if the conversation has become hurried, jumbled or unproductive. The guardian may call for time out or a rest break as needed, watch timeliness, and help members see conflict arising and face it creatively. It should be noted that anyone can call for a time-out, or ask for the talking piece, but the guardian should be especially looking for these opportunities.

***Talking Piece***

The talking piece can be any object, literal or metaphorical that can be easily *passed.* This may be an *object* from Nature, such as a stone, stick or feather, or an object that has meaning for a particular circle. When employed in a round of council, only the individual *holding* the talking piece speaks with other circle members listening without interruption.

A talking piece is used whenever there is a desire to move the conversation more slowly so everyone's stories, input or wisdom can be gathered. One member picks up or requests the talking piece, shares his/her thoughts or story and then passes it on in circle or to the host or *guardian* as appropriate. The talking piece progressing around the circle, either in sequence or by volunteering, until everyone has had an opportunity to contribute. As in checking-in, one may pass a turn and then speak after others have spoken.

***Checking out and Farewell***

At the close of a circle meeting, it is important to allow a few minutes for each participant to comment on what was learned, or sharing feelings of what connected in the heart and mind, bringing the circle to close.

Closing the circle by checking out provides a formal end to the meeting, a chance for participants to reflect on anything that has transpired.

As participants shift from council space to social space or private time, each release one another from the intensity of attention being in circle requires. Often after checking-out, the host, guardian, or volunteer will offer a few inspirational words or farewell, or signal a few seconds of silence before the circle is released.

Circle is not a dogmatic form, each circle developing its own unique personality and style. The circle structure brings its strength and adaptability from the first ancestral campfires, to the global age. Each circle contributes to the long-held human tradition through the practices of listening, speaking, and thoughtful actions.

### *Cooperation and Harmony ~ Soil Makers and Salon Circle Projects and Events*

#### *Dynamic Governance Values*
- Effectiveness: Get things done
- Transparency: Open - Everyone knows
- Equivalence: Fairness/ equality

#### *Governing Principles*
- Consent decision making : decisions are made by consent not consensus.

- Circle organization : semi-autonomous self-governing groups, each of which has its own goals, and the responsibility to direct, operate and measure its own processes.

- Double Linking : An appointed representative of each working group (circle) participates with equal power in the governing group (circle) that oversees and supports the decision making processes and initiatives. Likewise an elected operational leader from the governing group (circle) participates in the working group. The governing group also sends an appointed representative to a higher level governing group, if one exists, and accepts an operational leader elected by that governing group as well.

#### Key Benefits
- Fast equivalent decision making process
- Objections are welcome and inform and evolve proposals
- Objections are validated in relation to the vision and shared aims
- Power is given to reason
- Roles are elected, not volunteered
- Full proposals are brought to meetings and are: Solution based (every problem comes with at least 3 solutions) AND- All decisions are time bound and reevaluated

#### Challenges
- Requires training of all participants to be effective
- Requires efficient and timely communication and facilitation
