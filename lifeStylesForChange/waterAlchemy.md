# *The Water Rehabilitation Miracle Of Pro-Biotic Eco-Enzyme*

**Multi Purpose Cleaning and Healing Products: Whole Body, Built Environment and *Earth Care*.**
**Naturally; Anti-Bacterial, Anti-Fungal, Anti-Viral and a Natural Antiseptic.**

## *Water Alchemy - Recycling organic materials through living organisms naturally purifies water.*
***Water Alchemy*** is the ongoing exploration of what happens when people connect head, heart, and body in the crucible of the water. The ancient alchemists combined substances and used the influence of their own minds to study the transmutation of matter and of spirit. Observe when the discursive mind becomes quieter and the intelligence of the heart comes to the foreground, a new ecologically symbiotic consciousness emerges. Work in symbiotic partnership with the more-than-human world and make incredible discoveries. 

### *Water Therapy;* the practice of spending time *Cultivating Living Healing Water* for the purpose of enhancing Whole Health, Earth Care, Wellness, and Happiness. A practice of *Symbiotic Connection* with the natural world and with each other, *healing water to soul.*

#### ***Conservation as a consequence of production.***

***Symbiotic Living; Pro-biotic Eco-enzyme Cleaning is Healing and Caring for Earth Mothers- Water, Soil and Air.***

**Explore an alternative way to connect; Symbiotically clean, heal and support the whole body in a way that cleans, heals and supports the environment. A pro-biotic rich super food for the micro-biome of the Physical Body and Mother Earth.** 

#### *Self-care that goes far beyond the self.*

**Symbiotically nourishing, fortifying and gentle. Remarkably enough the Physical Body and Mother Earth find natural healing benefits from this one easy process.**

*Yes, Nature is that simple, effective and synergistic.*

#### *What is Pro-biotic Eco-enzyme*

**A simple process of encouraging natural fermentation by lactic acid-forming bacteria such as Lactobacillus species and naturally-occurring wild yeasts of fruit and plant food remnants and brown sugar.**

**Through fermentation, the ingredients used for making Pro-biotic Eco-enzyme will have effect on each other, creating a complex but stable enzymatic ecosystem.** 

The microbes eat the sugars, digesting them and excrete metabolites. A detoxification and transfer of anti-nutrients into nutrients occurs, with nutrient enhancement and the creation of micro-nutrients. An abundance of LAB lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and molds that produce enzymes, break down and alter the original foods. 

Following fermentation, the natural anti-bacterial properties of fruit peels are further enhanced as organic substances are decomposed, yielding secondary metabolites known as bio-active compounds or phytochemicals. The process creates new amino acids, organic acids, and antioxidants that didn’t originally exist in the raw material, naturally optimized to provide the most nutrition.

**A pro-biotic power house is born.**
The fermentation process naturally increases the bio-availability, making it so the physical body and Mother Earth are able to absorb the nutrients. 

Eco-enzymes are complex organic substance of protein chains, mineral salts and juvenile hormones.

The extraction of enzymes, organic acids, and phenolic compounds through the fermentation process is preferred over conventional methods that require costly solvents, involve the possible degradation of heat-labile compounds, and through which it is difficult to obtain high purity extracts.

There are many targeted uses for these metabolites. LAB are applied in food production and preservation, companies package them and sell them at a high cost. The majority of products on the market are powdered or freeze-dried, this process causes damage to the microbes, resulting in 90 to 95% die off. This means, even though colony counts are high, only 5 to 10% of the microbes are actually alive.

#### *Few create a product that can truly rival real, live home ferments.*

**Teaming with antioxidants, Pro-Biotic Eco-enzyme is a powerful multi-functional tool.**

#### *Why make Eco-Enzyme?*

**Waterborne infections account for 80% of all infectious diseases.**
There is a serious global environmental resource problem of water, soil and energy that are now coming to bear on *Life As People Know It:* food production, malnutrition, the incidence of diseases, ... . By 2025, half the world population will be living in water-stressed areas.(WHO) People are literally killing the micro-biome with chemicals that alter this grand vast unknowable microbial balance of Mother Earth. 

**Re-use of wastewater, to recover water, nutrients, or energy, is becoming an important strategy.**

#### *water*
It is very difficult to reverse the effects of water pollution. Natural processes that cleanse the water can take years, decades, or even centuries, and even with costly technological processes, it can take years to remove all of the harmful substances from the water. There are many aspects of the contamination that must be removed. **First, and most importantly, the source of the water pollution must be removed, so that additional water contamination does not occur.**

**Home Cleaning products and fertilizers made with chemicals and pesticides pollute the underground water, rivers and surrounding ecosystems.** Pharmaceutical drugs and personal care products, also manufactured by many pharmaceutical companies (such as sunscreen lotions, lipsticks, deodorants, perfumes, body soaps, and shampoos, ...), are produced in staggeringly huge quantities; **often equaling or surpassing agrochemicals in tonnage.** The volume consumed is simply astounding. All of these go into the ecosystem, most of them into waste treatment systems. These conventional cleaning products contain harmful amounts of chemicals such as phosphate, nitrates, ammonia, chlorine etc. The accumulated effect of these chemicals released from every household causes significant damage to the health of the environment and the body. 

#### *Pro-biotic Eco-enzyme is a solution to some very big problems. By symbiotically keeping the body healthy and restoring vitality and strength to the environment. It is easily done at negligible cost, free of harmful pollutants, effective, and multipurpose.*

### *Stop the killing Gaia is a Micro-biome - Cultivate Cultures That Heal*

**Pro*Biotic*; For Life.**

**Science defines Pro-biotic as live micro-organisms that, "when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host."**

**Pro- ‘for, on behalf of’.**

**Biotic- ‘life’.**

**Why make Pro-Biotic Eco-Enzyme?**

*On Behalf Of Life.* A Gift of Life, given symbiotically by cleaning and healing the whole body and built environment with Pro-biotic Eco-enzyme. More than skin deep, **Soul Food for the Micro-biome, Soil to Soul.**

### *Symbiotic Microbial Gardens, Body and Soil .* 

#### *There is a micro-biome connection between Humans and the Soil, Humus.*
 
**A healthy micro-biome, which consists of an overwhelming majority of beneficial pro-biotic bacteria, is one of the most fundamental aspects of health.**

**The human body contain 10 times more bacteria than human cells, meaning around 100 trillion microbes make up the physical human body. Humans are Wild in this way.** The largest colony is located in the stomach and intestines. The bacteria digest substances that help the immune system defend against invaders. This exact same process happens symbiotically, in soil, water and the food that comes from it. Protect the microbes with Pro-biotic Eco-enzyme. Doing so will keep the micro-biome full of live beneficial organisms, which will help keep digestion, immunity and overall health on track. **Body, Soil and Water encourage the growth of healthy bacteria.**

Fermentation naturally produces Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), one of the most well studied bacterial groups known from ancient times. *Lactic acid - this molecule occurs in almost every living organism and it plays an essential role in the anaerobic energy metabolism of billions of life forms.* These valuable micro-organisms are used in numerous areas, especially food industry and medicine. LAB produce a wide range of compounds for food upgrading. Moreover, LAB can find special applications like generation of bio-energy not affecting the surrounding environment.

### Re-Act To The Environ-Mental Realities 

**Eco-Enzyme is an ecologically responsible solution,** for those living in apartments/condos or for those looking to use their fresh food remnants as a **nutrient rich pro-biotic water and soil amendment.** Use in the garden, plant pots or the environment as a gift of thanks, pro-biotic water for Mother Earth. No traditional 'garden' is required! Be creative. Whats around ...

#### Discover the Miracle of Pro-Biotic Eco-Enzyme and how it impacts:

- Climate Change
- Water Pollution
- Soil Pollution
- Waste Disposal
- Land Management & Urban Sprawl

**Lifestyles For Change- Fermenting fresh organic kitchen matter can reduce 70% of the total waste production and reduce the bad gases produced during organic decomposition, while saving the environment by creating a beneficial, symbiotic substance to combat the negative use of toxic chemicals and pollutants.**

Methane gas released from poorly disposed organic food waste can trap 21 times more heat than CO2, worsening the global warming condition.

#### *Pro-biotic Eco-enzyme Benefits:*

***Naturally; Anti-Bacterial, Anti-Fungal, Anti-Viral and a Natural Antiseptic.***

**Stable**- If the ferment is full of its necessary nutrients, it can survive even at pH value below 3.5, this ferment usually produces a beautiful safe and stable pH range of 4.5-5. The fermentation can remain active even at temperatures as high as 100C. 

**Safe**- Naturally teaming with antimicrobial goodness, these bacteria inhibit the growth of pathogens naturally eliminating the need for preservatives. Ferments are toxic free and perfect for the most sensitive at any age.

**Medicinal**- LAB ferments are part of normal micro-flora of gastrointestinal and genitourinary (the urinary and genital organs) tracts, hence they are used as components of pro-biotic products.

**Bioremediation**- Biotechnology employs the use of living organisms, microbes and bacteria, in the removal of contaminants, pollutants, and toxins from soil, water, and other environments.

**Reduce Water Pollution**- Water pollution is a major global problem, one of the leading worldwide **causes of death and disease**, accounting for the deaths of more than 14,000 people daily(2006). Eco-Enzyme is utilized as a low-cost alternative to
improve wastewater treatment processes. A 9% solution of Eco-Enzyme has been effective in removing ammonia, nitrogen and phosphorus, and in neutralizing municipal wastewater, within a period of 5 days. The enzyme converts ammonia to nitrate (NO3-), a natural and useful hormone and nutrient for plants.

**Multiple Usage**- Natural household cleaner, body wash, mouth wash, wound healing, air purifier, laundry detergent, fabric softener, de-scaler, organic fertilizer, etc. Adding pro-biotic Eco-enzyme to food and water for feeding domestic animals can boost their immune system and improve the quality of poultry or meat.

**Purify Underground Water**- Eco-Enzyme residues flow underground and help to purify ground water they come in contact with. 

**Purify Air**- Cleaning with Eco-enzyme remove odors from toxic air released from smoking, car exhaust, chemical residues of household products, etc. 

**Clearing Drains**- Eco-enzyme can be used for clearing urban drains after a storm.

**Any plant matter can be used in this process, choose citrus and pineapple peel for there powerful cleaning and healing abilities and pleasing aroma.**

#### Pro-Biotic Eco-Enzyme is easy to make, three ingredients are required:
- molasses or brown sugar
- water

### *Method*
**How To Make Pro-Biotic Eco-Enzyme**

**The 1:3:10 Ratio**

1. Sugar: 1 part
2. Organic food remnants: 3 parts
3. Water: 10 parts

**Step 1:**
- Fill container half way with water, leaving room for expansion and fresh fruit remnants (50% of the volume).

**Step 2:**
- Put 1 part brown sugar in the container and stir.

**Step 3:**
- Put 4-5 parts fruit remnants into the container. The smaller chopped the pieces the better the ferment.
This is just a guideline, experiment and play with the ratio.

**Step 4:**
- Top up with water, close the container and let the mixture **ferment for 3 months.** It’s important not to expose the ferment to the air. During the first month, gases will be released during fermentation process. Pressure will built up in the container, release daily to avoid rupturing or use an airlock. Leave the cap a little lose or put a balloon over to avoid an explosion. A cloth with elastic is not suitable for this type of fermentation. Date the bin!

Fermentation time & environment: 3 months minimum, from the time stopped adding food remnants. Store in a dark environment away from excessive heat.

**Step 5:**
- Harvest Day! In a suitable size vessel with a suitable size strainer, separate the solids form the liquids. The filtered Eco-enzyme can be bottled and is ready for use. A portion of filtered solids can be used as a starter for the next batch, dried and used as a powdered fertilizer, add them to the [Bokashi](./soilAlchemy.md) bin, garden compost or turn them directly into the soil. Even dumping them down the toilet is perfectly fine.

#### *TIPS and Details:*

**Sugars**- Use molasses, brown sugar, jaggery or some similar sugar, it is full of minerals and will create a more rich product.

**Separate kitchen remnants**, think aroma and decomposition.
Different organics have different benefits aromas and textures. Separate citrus fruits like Orange, Lemon, Lime and Pineapple into a dedicated bin, these create a fantastic and powerful cleaning enzyme. Other aromatics and medicinal plants like Ginger, Aloe Vera Lemongrass, Tea, ... can be added for a luxurious whole body healing wash product.

**Use Airlocks for an anaerobic environment.** Keeping the ferment clean and free of insects. This is important for a nice functional product and for safety, **containers may burst if the gasses are not released.** Plastic containers are best suited for this reason. Repurposed plastic milk containers are perfect.

It’s a great idea to have a catch-all bin for everything else like veggie scraps that is just purely 'compost' for the garden and drains. Or add these to the [Bokashi](./soilAlchemy.md) pro-biotic soil building bin.

- Cut the ingredients into small pieces to let them break down faster.
- Make sure all the organic ingredients are covered by the sugar water.
- Don’t use oily food remnants (fish and meat) as ingredients, this will create a bad smell, put these in the bokashi soil building system.
- Leave some space at the top of the container for expansion.
- During fermentation keep away from direct sunlight.
- If small insects are found in the container, close the lid tightly and let those insects decompose. (Increasing protein content!)
- A white layer on the surface of Eco Enzyme is a sign that fermentation is healthy and underway. This is a natural and harmless Kahm yeast.
- Label the ‘Start Date’ on the container.
- The best Eco-Enzyme ferments are 3 months and longer, fermentation starts once the last organic ingredients are added into the container.

- Laundry detergent, natural fabric softener - 1:500
- Evaporative cooler - air freshener - 1:500
- Insect replant and fertilizer for the garden - 1:500

*Adding 50ml of liquid store bought detergent/shampoo to 1000ml of Eco-Enzyme make a great concentrated de-greaser/cleaner/shampoo. Drastically reducing consumption and mitigating harmful effects. Perfect for dish washing, laundry, shampoo and body wash.*

... The list goes on.

#### *Frequently Asked Questions*

Q: Use only one kind of fruit peels, or many different kinds?

A: Using various ingredients can create complex and stable enzymatic ecosystems. Therefore, it is better to use different kinds of fruit peels and herbal leaf. However! If looking for a product with more specific healing and fragrance profiles be more selective.

Q: Will there be bacteria in Eco-Enzyme after fermentation?
Is it safe to be used for personal cleaning?

A: Eco-enzyme contains natural acetic acid, bromelain (from pineapple),  probiotics, and antioxidants, which help fight bad bacteria on the skin’s surface. Eco-enzyme can reduce allergies caused by chemicals, eliminate harmful microorganisms and enhance cell regeneration. It is important to remember that the acidic value of Eco-enzyme sits at or below PH 5.0 if it has been fermented well. Remember to dilute accordingly. Eco-enzyme is very safe and makes a wonderfully gentle yet powerful wash for wound cleaning and healing. Safe for all family members to use.

The acetic acid in Eco-enzyme kills many strains of bacteria on household surfaces and inhibits the growth of new bacteria and mold. Eco-enzyme is natures all-natural cleaner. 

Eco-enzyme derived from pineapple (Ananas comosus) and orange (Citrus aurantium L.) peels have been shown to have anti-microbial as well as anti-inflammatory properties.The synergistic effect of the two Eco-enzymes increases the potency of their anti-microbial activity against a wide range of bacteria. The high content of poly-phenolic compounds and flavonoids in pineapple and orange peel extracts are found to be responsible for their excellent anti-microbial antioxidant activities.

Q: How to insure the Eco-enzyme is well fermented?

A: If the fermentation is successful, the liquid will turn yellowish to brown and will form a white layer on the surface. Otherwise, it will turn black or become moldy. If mold is black add brown sugar (same amount) and ferment for another month.
