#### *What is Probiotic Eco-Enzyme*
**Teaming with antioxidants, Eco-Enzyme is a powerful multi-functional tool.**

Through fermentation, the ingredients used for making Probiotic Eco Enzyme will have effect on each other, creating a complex but stable enzymatic ecosystem. A detoxification and transfer of anti-nutrients into nutrients occurs, with nutrient enhancement and the creation of micro-nutrients.

Following fermentation, the natural antibacterial properties of fruit peels are further enhanced as organic substances are decomposed, yielding secondary metabolites known as bioactive compounds or phytochemicals. The extraction of enzymes, organic acids, and phenolic compounds through the fermentation process is preferred over conventional methods that require costly solvents, involve the possible degradation of heat-labilecompounds, and through which it is difficult to obtain high purity extracts.

Eco Enzyme is an organic compound that is naturally synthesized with plant protein, minerals and juvenile hormone.


#### *Why make Eco-Enzyme?*

**Cleaning products made with chemicals pollute the underground water, rivers and surrounding eco-systems.** These conventional cleaning products contain harmful amounts of chemicals such as phosphate, nitrates, ammonia, chlorine etc. The accumulated effect of these chemicals released from every household causes significant damage to the health of the environment and the body. Eco-enzyme is more than a general cleaner, organic fertilizer, air purifier, insect repellent, laundry wash, and body care product. **It's a solution to a very big problem.** By symbioticly keeping the body healthy and restoring vitality and strength to the environment. It is easy to DIY at negligible cost, free of harmful pollutants, effective, and multipurpose.

**Eco-Enzyme is an ecologicaly responsible option** for food remnants, those living in apartments/condos or for those looking to use their food remnants as a nutrient rich probiotic water and soil amendment. Use in the garden, plant pots or the environmet as a gift of thanks, probiotic water for Mother Earth. No garden is required! Be creative. Whats around ...

**Discover the magic of eco-enzyme and how it impacts:**

- Climate Change
- Water Pollution
- Waste Disposal
- Land Management & Urban Sprawl

Fermenting organic kitchen matter can reduce 70% of the total waste production and reduce the bad gases produced during organic decomposition, while saving the environment by creating a beneficial, symbiotic substance to combat the negative use of toxic chemicals and pollutants.

#### *Some Eco-Enzyme Benefits:*

**Safe**- Eco-Enzymes are toxic free and perfect for the most sensitive skin at any age.

**Reduce Pollution**- Methane gas released from disposed garbage can trap 21 times more heat than CO2, worsening the global warming condition.

**Multiple Usage**- Natural household cleaner, body wash, wound healing, air purifier, laundry detergent, car care, fabric softener, organic fertilizer, etc. Adding Eco Enzyme to food and water for feeding domestic animals can boost their immune system and improve the quality of poultry or meat.

**Purify Underground Water**- Enzyme residues flow underground and help to purify ground water that they come in contact with.

**Purify Air**- Remove odors from toxic air released from smoking, car exhaust, chemical residues of household products, etc.

**Clearing Drains**- Eco-enzyme can be used for clearing city drains after a storm.

**Any plant matter can be used in this process, chose citrus and pineapple peel for there powerful cleaning abilities and pleasing aroma.**

#### *Eco Enzyme is easy to make, three ingredients are required:*

- brown sugar
- water
- food remnants

**Air Purifier**

Under fermentation ozone, O3 is emitted from the fermentation vessel, and acts as a air purifier for the home. O3 escapes and attaches to other contaminants in the air then breaks and becomes O2. The same act of nature happens during a lightning storm, notice the fresh air after such an event.

**Fertilizer**

Eco Enzyme can also turn ammonia into nitrate NO3, which is a fertilizer. It
can transform carbon dioxide into CO3, which can nourish plants, fish and other living microbes on the planet.

It’s important not to expose the ferment to the air. The fermentation can remain active even at temperatures as high as 100C. Thought the fermentation process carbon dioxide is absorbed and oxygen released.

**Stable**

If the enzyme is full of its necessary nutrients, it can survive even at pH.
value below 3.5. A safe, stable stage to shoot for is about 4.5 - 5.

**This fermentation process creates a product rich in antioxidants, which decelerate the aging of cells.**

From a baby bath to washing a bicycle! Probiotic Eco-Enzyme can do it all, and more.

#### *Method*
**How To Make Probiotic Eco Enzyme**

**The 1:3:10 Ratio**

1. Sugar: 1 part
2. Organic food remnants: 3 parts
3. Water: 10 parts

**Step 1:**
- Fill container half way with water, leaving room for expansion and fruit remnants (50% of the volume).

**Step 2:**
- Put 1 part brown sugar in the container and stir.

**Step 3:**
- Put up to 3 parts fruit remnants into the container.
This is just a guideline, experiment and play. The smaller choped the pieces the better the ferment.

**Step 4:**
- Close the container and let the mixture **ferment for 3 months.** In the first week inspect daily, open and stir or shake. If not using a airlock this must be done daily! Leave the cap a little lose or put a balloon over to avoid an explosion! A cloth with elastic is not suitable for this type of fermentation. Date the bin!

**Step 5:**
- Harvest Day!!! In a suitable size vessel with a suitable size strainer, separate the solids form the liquids. The filtered enzyme can be bottled and is ready for use following the dilution ratios provided (see attached chart). A portion of solids can be used as a starter for the next batch, or dried and used as a powdered fertilizer. Add them to the garden compost or turn them directly into the soil. Even dumping them down the toilet is perfectly fine.

**Fermentation time & environment:** 3 months minimum, from the time stopped adding food remnants. Store in a dark environment away from excessive heat.

#### *TIPS and Details:*

**Use brown sugar**, jaggery or some similar sugar, it is full of minerals and will create a more rich product.

**Separate kitchen remnats**, think aroma and decomposition. Orange, Lemon, Pineapple, Apples, … Citrus are beautifully aromatic and make powerful cleaners.

**Use Airlocks for an anaerobic environment.** Keeping the ferment clean and free of insects. This is important for a nice functional product and for safety, **containers may burst if the gasses are not released.** Plastic containers are best suited for this reason. Repurposed plastic milk containers are perfect.

Different organics have different benefits, aromas and textures. Separate citrus fruits like Oranges, Lemons, Limes and pineapple into a dedicated bin, these create a fantastic and powerful cleaning enzyme. Other aromatics like Ginger, Lemongrass, Tea, ... can be added for a luxurious whole body washing product.

The list goes on! It’s a great idea to have a catch-all bin for everything else like veggie scraps that is just purely 'compost' for the garden and drains. Or add these to your Bokashi probiotic soil building bin.

**Probiotic eco-enzyme can simply be dumped down the toilet in reasonable portions, taking care to ensure no large chunks remain. Use in the garden, or can be dumped it in the sewer drain.**

#### *Other Tips*

- Cut the ingredients into small pieces to let them break down faster.
- Make sure all the organic ingredients are covered by the sugar water.
- Don’t use oily food remnants (fish and meat) as ingredients, this will create a bad smell, put these in the bokashi soil building system.
- Leave some space at the top of the container to let the mixture ferment and expand.
- Put the enzyme container in a space away from direct sunlight.
- If small insects are found in the container, close the lid tightly and let those insects decompose. (Increasing protein content!)
- A white layer on the surface of Eco Enzyme is a sign that fermentation is healthy and underway.
- Don’t forget to label the ‘Start Date’ on the container!
- The best Enzyme ferments are 3 months and longer.

Remember: The 3-month period for fermentation starts once the last organic ingredients are added into the container.

#### *Frequently Asked Questions*

Q: Use only one kind of fruit peels, or many different kinds?

A: Using various ingredients can create complex and stable enzymatic ecosystems. Therefore, it is better to use different kinds of fruit peels and herbal leaf. However! If looking for a product with more specific healing and fragrance profiles be more selective.


Q: Will there be bacteria in Eco-Enzyme after fermentation?
Is it safe to be used for personal cleaning?

A: Eco-Enzyme contains natural acetic acid, bromelain (from pineapple),  probiotics, and antioxidants, which help fight bad bacteria on the skin’s surface. Eco Enzyme can reduce allergies caused by chemicals, eliminate harmful microorganisms and enhance cell regeneration. It is important to remember that the acidic value of Eco-Enzyme sits at or below PH 5.0 if it has been fermented well. Remember to dilute accordingly. Eco-Enzyme is very safe and makes a wonderfully gentle yet powerful wash for wound cleaning and healing. Safe for all family members to use.

The acetic acid in Eco-Enzyme kills many strains of bacteria on household surfaces and inhibits the growth of new bacteria and mold. Eco-Enzyme is natures all-natural cleaner. 

Eco-enzyme derived from pineapple (Ananas comosus) and orange (Citrus aurantiumL.) peels have been shown to have antimicrobial as well as anti-inflammatory properties.The synergistic effect of the two eco-enzymes increases the potency of their antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria. The high content of polyphenolic compounds and flavonoids in pineapple and orange peel extracts are found to be responsible for their excellent antimicrobial andantioxidant activities.

Q: How to insure the Eco-Enzyme is well fermented?

A: If the fermentation is successful, the liquid will turn yellowish to brown and will form a white layer on the surface. Otherwise, it will turn black or become moldy. If mold is black add brown sugar (same amount) and ferment for another month.
