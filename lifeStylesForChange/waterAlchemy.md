#### *What is Probiotic Eco-Enzyme*
***Eco-Enzyme - Fermented Fruit Peel (Orange, lemon, lime and Pineapple)***
**Teaming with antioxidants, Eco-Enzyme is a powerful multi-functional tool.**

Through fermentation, the ingredients used for making Probiotic Eco Enzyme will have effect on each other, creating a complex but stable enzymatic ecosystem. A detoxification and transfer of anti-nutrients into nutrients occurs, with nutrient enhancement and the creation of micro-nutrients.

Following fermentation, the natural antibacterial properties of fruit peels are further enhanced as organic substances are decomposed, yielding secondary metabolites known as bioactive compounds or phytochemicals. The extraction of enzymes, organic acids, and phenolic compounds through the fermentation process is preferred over conventional methods that require costly solvents, involve the possible degradation of heat-labilecompounds, and through which it is difficult to obtain high purity extracts.


#### *Why make Eco-Enzyme?*

**Cleaning products made with chemicals pollute the underground water, rivers and surrounding eco-systems.** These conventional cleaning products contain harmful amounts of chemicals such as phosphate, nitrates, ammonia, chlorine etc. The accumulated effect of these chemicals released from every household causes significant damage to the health of the environment and the body. **Eco-enzyme is a solution to a very big problem.** By symbioticly keeping the body healthy and restoring vitality and strength to the environment. It is easy to DIY at negligible cost, free of harmful pollutants, effective, and multipurpose.

#### *Stop the killing Gaia is a Microbiome - Cultivate Cultures That Heal*

**Pro*Biotic*; For Life. People are literaly killing the microbiome with chemicals and chemical ladend foods that alter this grand vast unknown microbial balance in and around us.**

**What are probiotics? Science defines- Probiotics are live micro-organisms that, "when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host."**

**Pro- ‘for, on behalf of’.**

**Biotic- ‘life’.**

**Why make Eco-Pro*Biotics*? *On Behalf Of Life.* A Gift of Life, given symbiotically by cleaning the body and home with Eco-Pro*biotics*. More than skin deep, soul food for the microbiome of the Whole Skin, Water and Soil.**

#### **Body And Soil Microbial Gardens** 

**The human body contain 10 times more bacteria than human cells, meaning around 100 trillion microbes make up the physical human body. Humans are Wild in this way. The largest colony is located in the stomach and intestines. The bacteria digest substances that help the immune system defend against invaders. This exact same process happens in soil, water and the food that comes from it. Protect the microbes with Probiotics. Doing so will keep the microbiome full of live beneficial organisms, which will help keep digestion, immunity and overall health on track. Body and Soil, encourage the growth of healthy bacteria.**

**What all cultured 'foods' have in common is an abundance of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and moulds that produce enzymes which break down and alter the original foods. The microbes eat the sugars, digesting them and excrete metabolites. There are many targeted uses for these metabolites. Companies package them and sell them at a high cost. The majority of products on the market are powdered or freeze-dried, this process causes damage to the microbes, resulting in 90 to 95% die off. This means, even though colony counts are high, only 5 to 10% of the microbes are actually alive.** 

#### *Few create a product that can truly rival real, live home ferments.*

**Eco-Pro*Biotic* is a simple process for encouraging natural fermentation by lactic acid-forming bacteria such as Lactobacillus species and naturally-occurring wild yeasts of fruit and plant food remnants and brown sugar. The fermentation process produces amino acids and peptides that help skin’s cellular renewal.**

**Fermentation is a kind of detoxification process, a transfer of anti-nutrients into nutrients, nutrient enhancement and the creation of micro-nutrients occurs. This process also increases the bioavailability, making it so the skin is able to absorbe the nutrients, for brighter and more hydrated skin. The process creates new amino acids, organic acids, and antioxidants that didn’t originally exist in the raw material, naturaly optimized to provide the most nutrition to the skin. The fermentation process transforms the natural substances into a lightweight essence that immediately seeps into skin and mildly exfoliates it with lactic acid. A product that can be applied as a moisturizer, serum or mask, enabling the skin to more readily accept and absorb these ingredients.**

#### *There is a microbiome connection between our Skin and the Soil.* 

**Eco-Enzyme is an ecologicaly responsible option** for fresh fruit remnants, those living in apartments/condos or for those looking to use their food remnants as a nutrient rich probiotic water and soil amendment. Use in the garden, plant pots or the environmet as a gift of thanks, probiotic water for Mother Earth. No garden is required! Be creative. Whats around ...

**Discover the magic of eco-enzyme and how it impacts:**

- Climate Change
- Water Pollution
- Waste Disposal
- Land Management & Urban Sprawl

**Fermenting organic kitchen matter can reduce 70% of the total waste production and reduce the bad gases produced during organic decomposition, while saving the environment by creating a beneficial, symbiotic substance to combat the negative use of toxic chemicals and pollutants.**

#### *Some Eco-Enzyme Benefits:*

**Safe**- Eco-Enzymes are toxic free and perfect for the most sensitive skin at any age.

**Reduce Pollution**- Methane gas released from disposed garbage can trap 21 times more heat than CO2, worsening the global warming condition.

**Multiple Usage**- Natural household cleaner, body wash, wound healing, air purifier, laundry detergent, car care, fabric softener, organic fertilizer, etc. Adding Eco Enzyme to food and water for feeding domestic animals can boost their immune system and improve the quality of poultry or meat.

**Purify Underground Water**- Enzyme residues flow underground and help to purify ground water that they come in contact with.

**Purify Air**- Remove odors from toxic air released from smoking, car exhaust, chemical residues of household products, etc.

**Clearing Drains**- Eco-enzyme can be used for clearing city drains after a storm.

**Any plant matter can be used in this process, chose citrus and pineapple peel for there powerful cleaning abilities and pleasing aroma.**

#### *Eco Enzyme is easy to make, three ingredients are required:*

- brown sugar
- water
- fresh fruit remnants

It’s important not to expose the ferment to the air. The fermentation can remain active even at temperatures as high as 100C. Thought the fermentation process carbon dioxide is absorbed and oxygen released.

**Stable**

If the enzyme is full of its necessary nutrients, it can survive even at pH.
value below 3.5, this ferment usually produces a beautiful safe and stable pH. range of 4.5 - 5.

**This fermentation process creates a product rich in antioxidants, which decelerate the aging of cells.**

#### *Delicously rich, gourmet food for the microbiome of your skin. Fermented ingredients are like a supercharged turbo boost for your skincare routine.*

**A healthy skin microbiome, which consists of an overwhelming majority of beneficial probiotic bacteria, is one of the most fundamental aspects of good health.**

**Fermentation naturally produce AHAs, the all-important ingredient that helps slough away dead skin to reveal its natural gorgeous glow. AHA- Alpha hydroxy acids work by “loosening” the top layer of dead skin cells on your skin, revealing the healthy, newer skin underneath.**

**Lactic acid, the gentle sister of the AHAs and the ideal choice for those with sensitive skin. Lactic acid is known for making the skin extremely soft while also brightening those PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) spots, improving skin tone, and increasing the collagen production in your skin. Like AHAs it also helps with acne, blackheads, and whiteheads.**

#### Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are one of the most well-studied bacterial groups known from ancient times. LAB are part of normal microflora of gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, hence they are used as components of probiotics.

- **Working by accelerating skin cell turnover (exfoliating) and act as a moisturizer and humectant, meaning it draws water into the skin, helping to plump-up the skin and give you a smoother, more youthful appearance.**

- **Lactic acid works to clear pores and control breakouts on face and body without stripping moisture levels. Gently removes dirt and oil without over-drying the skin, and helps protect skin from environmental aggressors.**

- **Lactic acid can be used to help prevent and reverse signs of aging and sun damage, improve uneven skin tone, acne and dull looking skin. Reported to be effective in treating uneven skin tone or pigment issues like melasma, sun spots and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (the darkness that gets left behind after acne, a burn or injury to the skin).** 

**Fermented skincare products are naturaly teaming with antimicrobial goodness, these bacteria inhibit the growth of pathogens naturaly eliminating the need for preservatives.**

#### *Method*
**How To Make Probiotic Eco Enzyme**

**The 1:3:10 Ratio**

1. Sugar: 1 part
2. Organic food remnants: 3 parts
3. Water: 10 parts

**Step 1:**
- Fill container half way with water, leaving room for expansion and fresh fruit remnants (50% of the volume).

**Step 2:**
- Put 1 part brown sugar in the container and stir.

**Step 3:**
- Put up to 3 parts fruit remnants into the container.
This is just a guideline, experiment and play. The smaller choped the pieces the better the ferment.

**Step 4:**
- Close the container and let the mixture **ferment for 3 months.** In the first week inspect daily, open and stir or shake. If not using a airlock this must be done daily! Leave the cap a little lose or put a balloon over to avoid an explosion! A cloth with elastic is not suitable for this type of fermentation. Date the bin!

**Step 5:**
- Harvest Day!!! In a suitable size vessel with a suitable size strainer, separate the solids form the liquids. The filtered enzyme can be bottled and is ready for use. A portion of solids can be used as a starter for the next batch, dried and used as a powdered fertilizer, or add them to the garden compost or turn them directly into the soil. Even dumping them down the toilet is perfectly fine.

**Fermentation time & environment:** 3 months minimum, from the time stopped adding food remnants. Store in a dark environment away from excessive heat.

#### *TIPS and Details:*

**Use brown sugar**, jaggery or some similar sugar, it is full of minerals and will create a more rich product.

**Separate kitchen remnats**, think aroma and decomposition. Orange, Lemon, Pineapple, Apples, … Citrus are beautifully aromatic and make powerful cleaners.

**Use Airlocks for an anaerobic environment.** Keeping the ferment clean and free of insects. This is important for a nice functional product and for safety, **containers may burst if the gasses are not released.** Plastic containers are best suited for this reason. Repurposed plastic milk containers are perfect.

Different organics have different benefits, aromas and textures. Separate citrus fruits like Oranges, Lemons, Limes and pineapple into a dedicated bin, these create a fantastic and powerful cleaning enzyme. Other aromatics like Ginger, Lemongrass, Tea, ... can be added for a luxurious whole body washing product.

The list goes on! It’s a great idea to have a catch-all bin for everything else like veggie scraps that is just purely 'compost' for the garden and drains. Or add these to your Bokashi probiotic soil building bin.

**Probiotic eco-enzyme can simply be dumped down the toilet in reasonable portions, taking care to ensure no large chunks remain. Use in the garden, or can be dumped it in the sewer drain.**

#### *Other Tips*

- Cut the ingredients into small pieces to let them break down faster.
- Make sure all the organic ingredients are covered by the sugar water.
- Don’t use oily food remnants (fish and meat) as ingredients, this will create a bad smell, put these in the bokashi soil building system.
- Leave some space at the top of the container to let the mixture ferment and expand.
- Put the enzyme container in a space away from direct sunlight.
- If small insects are found in the container, close the lid tightly and let those insects decompose. (Increasing protein content!)
- A white layer on the surface of Eco Enzyme is a sign that fermentation is healthy and underway.
- Don’t forget to label the ‘Start Date’ on the container!
- The best Enzyme ferments are 3 months and longer.

Remember: The 3-month period for fermentation starts once the last organic ingredients are added into the container.

#### *Frequently Asked Questions*

Q: Use only one kind of fruit peels, or many different kinds?

A: Using various ingredients can create complex and stable enzymatic ecosystems. Therefore, it is better to use different kinds of fruit peels and herbal leaf. However! If looking for a product with more specific healing and fragrance profiles be more selective.


Q: Will there be bacteria in Eco-Enzyme after fermentation?
Is it safe to be used for personal cleaning?

A: Eco-Enzyme contains natural acetic acid, bromelain (from pineapple),  probiotics, and antioxidants, which help fight bad bacteria on the skin’s surface. Eco Enzyme can reduce allergies caused by chemicals, eliminate harmful microorganisms and enhance cell regeneration. It is important to remember that the acidic value of Eco-Enzyme sits at or below PH 5.0 if it has been fermented well. Remember to dilute accordingly. Eco-Enzyme is very safe and makes a wonderfully gentle yet powerful wash for wound cleaning and healing. Safe for all family members to use.

The acetic acid in Eco-Enzyme kills many strains of bacteria on household surfaces and inhibits the growth of new bacteria and mold. Eco-Enzyme is natures all-natural cleaner. 

Eco-enzyme derived from pineapple (Ananas comosus) and orange (Citrus aurantiumL.) peels have been shown to have antimicrobial as well as anti-inflammatory properties.The synergistic effect of the two eco-enzymes increases the potency of their antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria. The high content of polyphenolic compounds and flavonoids in pineapple and orange peel extracts are found to be responsible for their excellent antimicrobial andantioxidant activities.

Q: How to insure the Eco-Enzyme is well fermented?

A: If the fermentation is successful, the liquid will turn yellowish to brown and will form a white layer on the surface. Otherwise, it will turn black or become moldy. If mold is black add brown sugar (same amount) and ferment for another month.
