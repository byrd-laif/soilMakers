# The Alchemy of Life
**A Laboring of Love, The Healing Spirit Of Nature***

***Alchemy of life*** is the ongoing exploration of what happens when someone connects head, heart, and body in the crucible of the Mother Earth. The ancient alchemists combined substances and used the influence of their own minds to study the transmutation of matter and of spirit. Working in symbiotic partnership within Mother Earth too cultivate incredible discoveries. Observing the discursive mind become quieter, as the intelligence of the heart comes to the foreground, feeling through nature an ancient *ecologically symbiotic consciousness* reemerges.

## *Conservation as consequence of lifestyle and work.*

***Bio-Logical Freedom; feeling free to swim in the rivers of Mother Earth without fear of reprisal.***

Its easy to destroy something, the challenge is to create something meaningful. To bring something back to the Village that someone can live from. Wo-Men don't have to abandon their 'modern' lives but they do have to protect Mother Earth.

### *Ancestral Healing; Cultivating cultures that heal cultivates compassion for mother earth, an act of humility.* Connecting to Mother Earth through her art, the alchemy of life. Soil and water are the ultimate store of energy, history is held in these molecules, vital energy that flows forever transporting light energies.

A series of guided invitations, natural cycles, bring one into the present moment, opening the doors of symbiotic communication within the soil, waters, and landscapes explored. Biologically re-connecting, encounter not just the soil, but the many ways nature mirrors humans, encountering oneself, Soil to Soul Food.

***People connect through Mother Earth; water, the universal solvent that speaks, taking the knowledge of the leaf from the mountains to the sea, and the rain, taking it up from the sea back to the mountains. Recycling organic materials through living organisms naturally purifies water.***

***Water, Soil, Air - bio-logical needs,*** freely having access to Mother Earth, Nature, Open Spaces, ***playing in these biological elements; liberates essential subconscious processes, especially in children.*** Generated by nature through people, there is a spontaneous confirmation of the life giving pattern, born directly out of people's feelings. 

Scientific experiments are not capable of generating a phenomenon of this extraordinary level of agreement.

#### *Once discovered as a fluid field of relationships, one can redefine it, as an entity; something that has a real existence, making it operational.*
