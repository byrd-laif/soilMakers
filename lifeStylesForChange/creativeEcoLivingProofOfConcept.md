# Bio*Philia* Living Design ~ Learning to live in the light of Nature.
(*Proof of concept: Oct 2016 - Jan 2020*)

**The cultivation of a symbiotic habitat for the individual as a *biological organism* in the *built environment* within the *biophysical environment.***

Civilized living; life-giving and life-sustaining with a high degree of refinement and comfort. Adaptable to all practical needs of life within an attractive built environment. ***Curated to allow enjoyment of nature as freely as possible.***

## *The symbiotic relationship between Wo-Man and environment is highlighted, not human and 'things'.*

Wo-Men have an inherited need to connect to nature and other biotic forms due to their *Evolutionary Dependence* on it for *Survival* and *Personal Fulfillment.* This is the human birth wright.

*Naturally tap into the abundant emotions of joy, grace, awe, wholeness, passion and compassion that are experienced from beauty in nature. An archaic revival of Wo-Mans symbiotic Gaian connection, honoring the feminine.*

### *Knowledge of the 'symbiotic evolutionary experience' and theory are shared here.*

**An effort to reach ones own potential and help others do so in the process.**

#### *The way out is a personal responsibility, the way out is in the soil. When the soil is healed the soul follows.*

*It's time to call home.* 
*To act and that act to transfer through nature.*

***Welcome to the***
#### *Vivarium ~ place of life*

*An interactive space curated to explore, learn, reflect, ... on how Wo-Man interact, impact and live in their personal environments; homes, work, travel, ..., spaces.*

Designing and creating symbiotic living environments that support, restore and regenerate both the physical body and the environment (earth body) have positive effects on the health of a population as a whole, not just the individual within the living design.

**Vivarium**- (Latin, literally for "place of life"; plural: vivaria or vivariums) is an area, usually enclosed, for keeping and raising animals or plants for observation or research. Often, a portion of the ecosystem for a particular species is simulated on a smaller scale, with controls for environmental conditions.

#### The aim; to harmonize the Natural World with the Modern World.

Mind, Body, Earth; Anima Mundi (world soul) Symbiotic Connections. 

An enchanted sensibility can be strategically cultivated to ***'Capitalize On The Use Of The Senses To Create Change'.***

Physical body is the placebo; the mind’s capacity to influence bodily functions and symptoms. 

Re-establishing and encouraging healthy symbiotic connections with nature through sensory experiences, interactions, movement, and hands-on activities. Allowing the brain and body to establish new, more productive patterns.

Inventing a new universe to live in, a universe of possibility. A place where people are continually discovering how they create their reality, and how they can change it.

#### Location

**George Town, Penang**

Due to the intermingling of the various ethnicities and religions that arrived on its shores, George Town acquired a large eclectic assortment of Colonial and Asian architectural styles. It also gained a reputation as gastronomic paradise. 

The Vivarium, central to many George Town attractions and just 500 meters from "Link Bike" a public bike rental station. Pulau Tikus Market/Hawker Center: 1.2km, Botanical Garden: 3.2km and UNESCO World Heritage Site: 2.6km. 

**The Neighborhood ~ Dunn Road**

The surrounding low density neighborhood is tranquil with many large trees, and properties with plenty of green space. Dunn Road is one of the preferred addresses on the island today.

#### The Building and Property

**Dunn House** is a freehold, 3-story residential apartment building with just 15 exclusive units, each 1230 square feet in size. Dunn House is one of the pioneering boutique developments of George Town, Penang.


#### *The Vivarium ~ place of life*

In October 2016 occupancy was privately secured for one of the third floor corner units, north-facing with three bedrooms. Permission had already been gained from the building management and residents for a food garden on the property that was already underway.

The unique design of the boutique residence offers each corner condo, three outside walls with large opening garden windows. Due to this design the Vivarium enjoyed a wonderful open feel and fantastic cross breeze. A conscious decision to experience the smell, sound and feel of an A/C free environment was made (a bold move at 5 degrees north of the equator).

Intentional privacy screening was installed to allows guests to open bedroom doors and take advantage of the natural flow of fresh air. Jute window covers where installed to provide natural air-conditioning. Additionally an evaporative cooler was used in the common area that helped in the creation of a pleasant micro climate.

**The Private Medicinal Food Garden;** boasted over ***27 large 5 gallon (or larger) containers*** located outside all bedroom windows, as well as ***22+ clay pots*** on the balcony. Nearly all plants being edible, medicinal or functional. Besides an assortment of herbs, aloe plants, and experimental seedlings like Durian the garden was home to 23 Moringa oleifera trees, Papaya trees, Coconut seedlings, Sacha inchi vines and a passion fruit vine (that tried to take over the laundry wire) where among the many plants. It became difficult to catalog the ever changing garden. Growing a diverse garden is part of what makes it a pleasure and easy to enjoy an Eco-responsible lifestyle. The gardens of the Vivarium, once established, was able to provided all nutritional requirements. (More details on plant selection and care will follow in a separate post.)

All rooms having several opening windows with large concrete window boxes provided ample space for gardens, easy access and beautiful ambience. The windows being covered in jute became gardens themselves and where home to over ***40+ bamboo hanging planters and Kokedama*** (苔玉, in English, literally "moss ball") a ball of soil, covered with moss, held by being wrapped in coconut cord on which ferns and other medicinal plants grew.

Guests where offered garden care responsibilities and to participate in any activities that may have been happening at the time. Guests where also encouraged to use the in-house Eco friendly body and home care products. Bathrooms had bidet water hose installed and small cotton towels were provided in place of toilet paper.

Rooms had low voltage LED lighting providing a pleasant healthy light, a large ceiling fan, and mosquito net to cover the bed.

Kitchen was well supplied for preparing modest meals. Washing machine was locate off the kitchen. Drinking water was arranged for delivery and offered to guests at market rate.

This was a shared private residence. At times the entire space was made available, mostly there was a live in host (curator) or co-host that helped the project literally stay alive, always self selected and in harmony with the concept. Guests where offered laundry service and a small 'A La Carte Menu' was also available for a modest fee.

**Marketing**

The Vivarium experience was marketed to "Creative Eco-Conscious Travelers" using Airbnb and Workaway platforms with a small team of dedicated local friends that helped make it all possible. The Vivarium listings attained "super host" status on the Airbnb platform.

Guests joined a journey of discovery as the Vivarium co-evolved and provided a space to share solutions to everyday environmental impacts; Bokashi soil building and pro-biotic enzyme cleaners were a large part of keeping the ecological footprint positive. This knowledge was freely shared to inquiring guests.

Every stay mattered to this self funded project, contributed and kept this creative living eco space alive, evolving and available to experience.

**Vivarium LifeStyle** - The decor was handcrafted from natural bamboo, wood, coconut and rattan. Handmade textiles of organic cotton, silk and hemp decorated the walls.

Living room was an open shared space, with beautiful cooling white marble floors, very spacious for any kind of body work. The furniture was locally custom built and designed to encourage healthy body movement, to relax and/or work. Space was ample to enjoy a tea on the patio and experience the company of visiting birds, that where always around, singing, exploring and foraging in the gardens that surrounded the unit.

#### Bedroom Options

*A peaceful nights sleep, a little sanctuary in the city, spacious and private.* All rooms included cotton linens and towels.

**Queen master bedroom** featured a 4pc ensuite, queen size bed, custom made Polynesian style wood platform and dedicated evaporative cooler. Spacious, even with luggage and two guests in the room one could still easily enjoy yoga. The private attached bathroom has a large vanity, mirror, sink, toilet, small window and full size bathtub with shower. This bathroom did not have hot water, for a hot shower guests accessed the shared 3 piece bathroom just outside the room. This room also featured a dedicated evaporative cooler, the addition of essential oils as part of the experience was offered.

**Double and Single Bedrooms:** each room featured a large corner window garden, natural wood parquet flooring and coconut tatami mats, each on there own custom made Polynesian style wood platform. Two large open custom design closets (double room) and a single large open custom design closet (single room) for easy access with plenty of room to hang clothes.

Coconut tatami mats offer spinal support, are naturally breathable and recommended for those that suffer allergies. 

**Shared bathroom** provide a mirror above the sink, toilet and standing shower with hot water, located just outside the bedrooms.

**Vivarium LifeStyle Guidelines**

The Vivarium was a shoe free environment, guests where asked to leave outdoor shoes at the secure entrance to the vivarium.

Additionally guests where asked to please shower before laying in the bed, and not lay in the bed with street clothes on (being a hot climate in a shared living space this was a matter of personal requirement). 

Guests where asked too leave windows open as much as possible for nice air flow and open the door of their room to enjoy and contribute to the flow of the whole space.

Guest where offered to participate during their stay and refrain from using personal care and body products that contain chemicals, artificial scents and other harmful agents.

**Guest Access**

Guests had access to the spacious living/dinning rooms. The kitchen was generally not open to guest use, fridge access was made available by request.

**Interaction with Guests**

Host and co-host were often around and someone was always contactable to help with anything guests needed. Host and co-hosts alike all loved good conversation with respect of guest privacy, engagement was at the discretion of the guest.

**Other things to note:**

Meals could be arranged.
Drinking water was available for purchase in house.
Laundry service was available for a fee.

This space was mostly shared with the host or co-host, all where quite strict about the house rules. This helped provide a clean and quiet environment for guests to stay. Guests where encouraged to ask questions prior to making a reservation.

**Images soon to come.** Many special events took place at the Vivarium in many different forms, Salon Style Programs and Salon Circle Gatherings among them. A few occasions where artfully captured by a talented videographer and photographer, [Hakima.](https://www.lensculture.com/hakima-hamdi)

The Vivarium ~ Queen Corner Bedroom - EnSuite Bath
Not merely a place to stay! Vivarium is beautiful and well thought out, with a spacious and airy feel. There is a conscious emphasis on using natural materials in the furnishings, natural cross ventilation instead of air con, and using edible plants to screen the windows for both beauty and augmenting the larder! I was in Penang specifically to train qigong with my teacher; staying at Vivarium complemented the classes. Easy stroll to a market, hawkers' food stalls and temples.

Very comfortable, secure, and open space in quieter part of town. We really enjoyed our time there and would definitely stay again. Bed is comfortable and there is a fan and mosquito net. Great food court, New World Park, is just a short Grab drive away, though we walked there most evenings for dinner. There have been problems with the wifi at the house, so if you need to be online, make sure you have a sim card, data is cheap enough, and coverage is good.

We had a wonderful and peaceful stay at Vivarium. Anna and Yanna were lovely and very helpful with local tips. They really put their heart into creating this eco space to support their green lifestyle in the city. Their home is located in a quiet neighborhood but not far to commute to Georgetown by grab. The place is very clean, spacious and airy. The airflow through the house is so amazing that you really don’t need an A/C at all. The whole place was exactly as described and shown on airbnb. The bedroom was spacious, minimal and comfortable. The place has such positive energy/relaxing vibes. Anna was very kind to us and she offered some kefir for us to try. We ended up buying some grains from her and we’re so excited to make our own kefir drink now. Thank you Anna and Yanna for sharing the knowledge/guidance and for the support through the process of making our own kefir and compost for a greener living.

Thanks so much for having me! I would definitely stay again, given the opportunity! Close to Gurney paragon, located halfway between Gurney and Komtar. 100 steps from bus stop where you can catch the 101 bus through georgetown or all the way up to Batu Ferringi. Beautiful home "eh" ;)

A wonderful place to stay! Everything is super clean and beautiful. To get into the city center you have to use a grab (6-8MYR), walking isn't recommended. But it's very nice to get out of the loud city trouble. So we definitely would come back and we recommend this place for everyone : )

Yana was very helpful in providing us some local tips. We really liked the eco style because you could feel the care Yana and Anna put in the place. It's in a quite and clean (no rats!) neighborhood and it's easy to move around in the town by Grab. I recommend the place for normal travellers and travellers who care about the environment as well. Thank you for everything

The place is exactly as advertised, very clean, good value for money, close to Georgetown historical sites (we used grab to get around), to stay within so many green plants was a real remedy for a soul of a tired traveler, definitely recommend for any budget or soul-searching traveler

I can’t say enough good things about this place! Yanna was VERY helpful and were always quick to respond to any of our questions. The whole place is EXACTLY as described and pictured on the airbnb site (very Natural, Eco-friendly and no AC - love it!). The room itself is clean, spacious and comfortable with the mosquito net covering the bed (keep in mind to always close it tight and nothing is going to bite you!). I was very lucky to have Yanna show me steps of cheese-making process! Her natural healthy (no preservatives!) Kefir, Cheese, Cream cheese were all amazing! I came to Penang for a medical check-up (as I've been coughing a lot lately), and Yanna has also given me a tea made of Indian Borage which she has planted with Anna - it stopped my cough! how amazing is that! Thank you so much Yanna for your kind hospitality, me and my mum will definitely come and visit this place again! :D

Peaceful place, filled with good vibes and energies. The room is minimal, super clean and offer everything you need. The building is located in an elegant and silent neighborhood just 30 minutes walk to the UNESCO protected zone. Yana, the co-host, provided useful tips on how to move around and get yummy street food. We will definitely stay there again when we will go back to Georgetown.

Serene, eco conscious space in a residential area on the edge of the busy streets. I found this a great place to stay and by walking or Grab can get about easily. I learnt how to live even simpler and left with kefir grains to make my own yoghurt , gifted from lovely Yana..

My stay at the Vivarium was a wonderful and powerful experience for me, a real life experience. Anna was one of the best person I ever met. She taught me a lot. I loved every moment spent with her, every talk. Spending a few days with Yana, just before my return to Europe, was life-saving. She was present with all her kindness, to help me to face this hard time. Anna and Yana are, now, two true friends who count a lot in my life. The Vivarium is a place of life and exchange unique. Everything there is thinking to impact the less as possible the environment. I learned a lot in this real eco-habitat. You will only find good vibrations. The plants are everywhere, they provide, in addition to refresh naturally the air, a real feeling of serenity. The neighborhood is residential, quiet, not far from the center and all amenities. I can only recommend this place and I will be back as soon as possible. Julie

Such a great, stylish space! It immediately makes you feel peaceful. Yana was extremely hospitable. She was always willing to give us suggestions on where to visit in Georgetown and even left us with some gifts to take home. The space is near most attractions you’d want to see in Penang. Loved every minute of our trip!

This apartment is VERY HOT. It has no air conditioning, and the water vaporizing machine they mention is actually useless. We have spent many weeks traveling around Malaysia and we realized you will need a proper AC, if you want to have a decent sleep during the night. While we stayed here we woke up many times during the night, as it was so hot. One other small issue: there is no door on the toilet, so you will see your partner while on the toilet, no privacy. Other than these two main issues, the apartment is great. The host is kind and ready to help any time. The bamboo furniture is fun. The location is great in a quite street. It is a bit away from most of the attractions, but you can always get a Grab and they will bring you wherever you go on a very low rate, so it's worth to stay in a calm area. I think if the owner wants to fulfill her vision about a green apartment with low environmental footprint, she should invest in proper insulation and a heat exchanger AC. I assume that would use the same amount of energy than the evaporator and the continuously running fans, and it could provide lower temperatures during the night.

We had a lovely stay in George Town at Anna’s place. The apartment is in a very clean, posh neighborhood next door to a Montessori school, and only a short Grab or taxi ride from most of the main attractions. There are also a number of cafes and hawker stalls within walking distance, although it’s not a terribly pedestrian-friendly area (not many sidewalks). The room itself was immaculate and very minimal, which we like, but be aware that if you don’t do well without air conditioning this may not be for you. Thanks, Yana and Anna, for a great first time in Penang! We hope to come back.

LOVE LOVE LOVE Anna's place! So much, that I booked it again after staying for 5 nights at the beginning of my trip and came back again for a few nights before flying back home. So peaceful, incredible energy, feels actually healing to stay there. The place is minimal which means it's not clattered with unnecessary things. Loved the breeze coming through all the time. The whole place was very clean, bed comfortable (especially after all the extra-firm mattresses in Asia) and I'm definitely inspired to replicate the bamboo cage for mosquito net in my garden! If you are coming to Penang and want to stay somewhere different, stay with Anna!

Having spent a considerable amount of time in Penang, I find the vivarium located in an ideal location; a sort of tree lined posh neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of central Georgetown. We used it primarily as a place of rest after a whole days out of island exploration. The building was a treat in itself as it evokes a certain charm of yesteryear. the vivarium was very clean with generous space, natural light and swaths of awesome plants, although the set up may not be up to general expectations. The philosophy of sustainable living philosophies should be at the back of mind while taking up residency at the vivarium. Regardless, we had a memorable stay. Alicia was incredibly warm and exudes good vibes all around.

Anna is the host you need, she was very welcoming, friendly and kind. Prepared your meal thoughtfully and punctually every single day. She has a really cool minimalist, healthy lifestyle and being in her place for a few days would surely bring in good positive vibes for you. The place was really nice. It was quiet, and calming. So little noises except for distant traffic and sometimes, ambulance. The room has a big window to city skyline, with green and red colored plants on the planter that welcomes brief morning sun ray, a great mood to start the day. Was spacious, very clean and tidy. Also..the bed was so cute with a mosquito net over a bamboo cage.

I wasn’t sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised at how much I learned from Anna about sustainable agriculture methods. She was good about communicating ahead of time and was gracious when I arrived early. Anna is very knowledgeable and passionate about plants, and their use in optimal health and healing. As we toured her garden, she picked items to use in a delicious and nutritious snack (which she prepared all while sharing her extensive horticultural knowledge). I found her outlook and vision to be refreshing and plan to visit again. By booking this trip, you will increase your understanding of how we can work in harmony with nature (plants, soil) to sustain life.

Anna and Julie’s place is just awesome. We had wonderful days there and seized the silence atmosphere around the site. The neighborhood is very safe, you can walk from city to the apartment without any problems. Our host was great, she gave us useful insiders and told where to go when. The room was just perfect for us, it was big enough and it really felt like home to stay there! I totally recommend this place! Thank you Julie!

Anna’s place is really beautiful and communication was so speedy. It is a little bit out of town but grab taxi are so cheap so it wasn’t really a problem. The lights weren’t as dim as I expected from reading other reviews so that wasn’t an issue for us. Would recommend!

Anna's place is great - it has a very tranquil feel, with windows looking out into lush green leaves. The caretaker, Julie, was very sweet and helpful with recommendations, and even lent me an umbrella for a rainy evening. It's a little bit out of the way, meaning that you either have to take a Grab or take a 20-25 minute walk to get to food or attractions. Otherwise, it was exactly as we expected it to be, and we had a lovely stay there.

Such a lovely, homely space outside of George Town. Having the windows open all the time kept the place surprisingly cool, although did mean I was constantly being eaten by mosquitos. Julie kept the common areas really clean which was really appreciated. It was a little far away from places to eat if you have no transport.

L’appartement correspond aux photos, la chambre est très agréable, ventilée, le matelas est très bien, la salle de bain spacieuse. Pour nuancer certains commentaires une j’ai pu lire... L’eau parfois coule un peu marronnasse mais sans que cela gêne, remplir sa bouteille d’eau pure coûte 0,20€ et la lessive 8 RM, c’est bien pratique. Le quartier est calme et plutôt cossu par contre assez excentré.

Good location and eye-opening to ecofriendliness, although it was something we weren't used to. Ecofriendly homemade body wash was provided but it smelled like vinegar so we went to get some from 7-Eleven which was fine. They were nice enough to make our beds when we were out as well. The room was nice, minimalistic and spacious - which made it easy for us to utilise the space freely. Toilet was spacious with lots of surfaces which might be useful if you brought a lot of toiletries. Some qualms: Lights were very , very dim even at night which made it uncomfortable and a red lantern was present in the room (in Chinese superstition, red light/lanterns are associated with supernatural instances). Water was brown and the sink was clogged throughout our stay. To get drinking water (can be deemed a basic necessity) in the house, we had to pay for it No hot water in the shower which made it a tad uncomfortable

This is by far the hippest Airbnb we've ever experienced! Anna and Li have an amazing thing going with their lifestyle of recycling, gardening and conservation! The location is also perfect: not in the center of George Town's hustle and bustle, but next to a public bike rental drop-off station, so getting around is cheap and easy! You really made our visit to George Town even more memorable!

If you are looking for a very cheap Airbnb in the middle of Georgetowns suburbs then this place might do, as long as you have very low hygiene standards. I was looking forward to staying in an “eco garden flat” but I feel that the host is merely using being green as an excuse to be lazy. The first issue I noticed, which I messaged Anna about, was that the bed stinks. Really stinks. I think it was mould or perhaps the linen has just been washed in the shower at Anna’s place as the water runs brown. It was very difficult to get used to the pillow smell and get some rest. Anna told me to lie them in the sun to clean them? Not acceptable. The lack of hot water and dodgy looking shower water did not do anything to make me feel any cleaner after a sweaty smelly nap. Perhaps I could have dealt with these issues had the flat been a bit better situated but you had to get a taxi everywhere you went (not so eco friendly) as the roads do not cater to pedestrians at all. My second biggest gripe was the living space. I’m not sure you can even call it a living room as there was no sofa!?! I am stupid for missing this in the picture but it’s never something I’ve thought to check for! The yoga room is indeed lovely but again there is nowhere to relax, just hardwood floors. Put a hammock up - they cost next to nothing! Thirdly, when we settled into sleep, in the 28degree heat (the old trick with the wet windows does nothing to air you out) a party started across the road every night at 10pm and didn’t stop until 4am, complete with Kareoke. I wouldn’t normally write a review like this but as I was refused a refund when we left because I couldn’t hack it anymore, I was informed by Anna (whom I assumed was the owner) that my request had been denied by “the landlord”. Very poor form considering all the above issues.

This was our best AirBnb experience ever. The Vivarium is everything Anna says about it, it feels like a living house and we loved it. We had a chance to take care of it, feel its positive energies and even cook some Okra from the shared garden downstairs. Anna was always available and quick to answer anything we asked, even about the city which is also amazing. We believe that traveling and staying in houses like Anna's is probably the best sustainable travel one can do. We are definitively going back to this house.

Anna’s apartment is lovely and airy as described. We didn’t miss the A/C as there’s almost always a breeze plus fans if you need them. There’s plenty of space and good views from it’s 3rd floor location. Note: there are mostly platforms for sitting and lying on with 2 adjustable seats with back support (no legs). We are 55+ are managed fine and left more flexible than we arrived! It is also on the 3rd floor with no elevator- also good for our health! Anna was very quick to respond to questions and very helpful with tips etc. The apartment location outside the city centre in an old established neighbourhood gives you a nice quiet break from people and traffic and there are plenty of food and shopping options nearby

Anna's place, "The Vivarium", is a welcome respite from the chaos and stress of every day life. It is a wonderful calming space that aims to teach an alternative way of interacting with our environment in a more respectful way. The road is peaceful and the marble floors and light open spaces make it a great space to come to at the end of the day, or to work from. Anna, although we didn't get to meet her, was attentive and quick to respond to any questions we had. We really enjoyed our stay and will be taking some of what we learnt back home.

Anna’s place is just as described and pictured. Communication with Anna was easy and quick. The place is huge with great cross breeze and ventilation. No concerns about the lack of AC. The garden is lovely and has edible plants; I made a meal using the herbs and moringa. The kitchen supplies all you need to prepare meals. The hot water in the shower is reliable, though hardly necessary. The neighborhood is not great for walking about, but UBER is quick, cheap, and reliable. Also, there are a couple of local bus stops near by (try taking the 101 along the North coast of the island). The walk over to the Pulau Tikus market is about 15 minutes along quiet roads. The market is amazing. The washing machine in the unit is a huge plus, and clothes dry very quickly in the open apartment. My husband and I really felt at home here, and I would recommend Anna’s place to anyone looking for a quiet retreat in Penang.

房间非常大,也很干净. 非常喜欢阳台.很漂亮. 但是唯一的问题就是早上7点的时候会有一些噪音,因为有人训练在喊口号. 房间的装修风格可以看出Anna 真的很喜欢中国文化. 位置距离市中心有些距离,但是不用担心,Uber可以带你去任何地方. 大概20分钟车程可以带你去到繁华的中心地段. 10分钟的车程你可以到达 George Town 的美食街,可以发现很多好吃的食物,比如非常出名的炒粿条 . 如果你像我一样爱步行,走路到达美食街估计要40分钟. 但是入住的位置很多uber司机都不知道,不过不用担心啦,现在都有谷歌地图也很方便. 总之是很不错的,值得入住.

Anna and Li are lovely hosts and very inspiring people - and their place is great! We loved our room - it was filled with light, it catches a nice breeze so together with the fan you don't need the aircon, and what was the best is that unlike in other places we've stayed in Asia we were actually able sleep with windows open which made a huge difference. It also has a big desk/platform where we were able to work (good wifi!). Anna can also teach you a lot about healthy lifestyle and organic gardening which we found fascinating. The house is located in a quiet part within a short Uber/bicycle ride from the old center - we were using the LinkBike bicycle sharing system whose one of the stations is conveniently located about 500m from the house. Anna and Li made sure we felt great during our stay and we definitely will stay in touch. Thanks Anna and Li!

Anna is a really great host. We had a really comfortable and cozy time at here flat and want to recommend it to you. Her way to build up an "eco living" is ambitious and fascinating- take the time and let her show their beautiful garden to you (from there she has made us some really great teas ♡ ). The flat is in a nice street from where you can walk to the centre of Georgetown or rent a scooter to drive everywhere in Penang. Anna was very helpful with all of our questions and gave us some nice tips and information that made our trip awesome. We really had a great time and would definitely come back to her. Thank you for everything, Anna!

Anna is nice and easy to communicate. The room is clean and eco-fresh with simple furniture. But it exactly with what Anna provide information on airbnb. The room has 2 aircon but maybe they are too old to work, Anna add a ceiling fan instead. It may be a little hot at noon. And the room does not have bright light to work at home However, Anna's place is quite a nice experience :)

Staying with Anna and Li was the highlight of our trip. They were wonderful hosts and made us feel at home. We loved sharing stories over tea, talking about life, and chilling in their spacious apartment. We liked the open air-style apartment and listening to the insects buzzing at night and the birds singing in the morning. A wonderful natural lifestyle experience! Anna shared her knowledge of herbs and gardening with us and inspired me to start my own garden. She makes amazing kefir and drinking it everyday saved my tummy! Comfortable bed, good wifi, all around positive experience and there are some great Indian food restaurants walking distance from the house!

Anna is fermentation expert and soul hippie, she creates amazing home made products & she'll make sure you drink your keifer everyday :) Li is a computer genius, very smart guy and I enjoyed having long conversations with him ( the rare kind of conversations that actually benefit you haha!) I wish you both the best with all your plans and will sure meet again!

Anna was out of town so her husband Li was around. Li opened the door for us. He is helpful and friendly. We requested for two pairs of keys and he went out to make an extra pair and pass to me the next morning. The place is just like in the pictures. Clean and simple. I love the bamboo framed mosquito net the most. But if you dread places with no AC. This place will not be the place foe you. Overall, it is much above average and value for money, great for a minimalist stay.

The room was huge. It only has a fuan but that was enough as it was quite strong. Having a toilet in the room was good. There's a bathtub in the toilet. The bed was very comfortable. Anna wasn't in town but her partner, Li, took care of us well. We arrived in Penang at 5am & he allowed us to check in earlier as there was no one using the room at that time. That was very helpful as we had the opportunity to rest & be fresh to explore the city in the day. Li is very friendly & was always helpful. It was definitely a good stay.

We loved, loved, loved Anna's place, it's one of a kind. Anna's environment-friendly, minimal-impact approach to life is something we are completely in tune with, in fact we have left with new knowledge and goodies which will improve the rest of our trip and not just that. The room is clean, spacious and comfortable, we especially appreciated the mosquito net above the bed, very useful at night as that allowed us to keep our windows open for lovely breeze instead of having to succumb to (much hated) A/C just to keep the bugs out. The furnishing of the house is minimal but well sufficient and very practical for the climate. The house is located in a quiet residential area easy to reach in 10 min drive or with Uber from the center of George Town. The location is perfect for good night sleep, something unexpected in such a busy and bustling town. It's also just 10 min walk from Pulau Tikus Hawkers Center, home to the best Hokien Mee we tried and the world renown Fried Oysters, your perfect destination for dinner. For breakfast there is another great hawkers center located on 218 Jalan Burma, where you can get a fantastic cup of coffee, dumplings in broth to die for and/or Curry Mee that beats any competition. Three nights in Penang made us strongly desire to relocate, for sure we'll come back and when we do, we are definitely going to stay longer. Anna's charming place would be our first choice for accommodation, we'd love to stay with her again. We recommend this option to any eco minded traveler out there, it's absolutely perfect.

I love the quiet area, which is still close to some of my favorite destinations on the island - such as the organic shops and the sweet morning market in nearby Pulau Tikus. I hope dear Anna will be running this place long time, so I can always come back to my home away from home in Malaysia. Great support in everything I could come up with and always an inspiration.

Bathroom was filthy - yellow stains in bath easy to remove even with shower gel, no hot water in shower, LED lights connected to cables hanging out of wall covered with isolation tape, light plug with no back cover kicking around floor. On first morning we asked for coffee and received 0.5l pot of coloured water at shocking price of 10 ringgit. Next morning (after my suggestion) coffee was noticeable stronger, but less water in pot. BTW in restaurant around the corner 200ml glass of devil-strong coffee cost 1.20 ringgit. Description says: "The kitchen is not open to guest use" during our stay we seen couple from other room freely entering kitchen - different rules for different guests?? Good location, secured building, however overall disappointing experience.

Unlike any commercial place listed as an eco-stay, Ecohome is actually a place where real efforts to live more sustainably are taking place. LED lighting, seedlings, recycling, fermentation - I learned so much. In this way then, it was an ideal place to stay with people who share my values and interests. But the icing on the cake is that it is also a lovely place to stay, clean, well organized, comfortable, walkable and wonderful friendly hosts. I hope I will have a chance to stay again.

I was looking for a quiet, rather green neighbourhood in Penang, that is close to the consulates and not too far from Georgetown - voilá! Anna's place is exactly this and more: Anna has a lot of inspiration to offer when it comes to alternative ways of living in an urban area. Plus I simply loved the stay in the spacious, airy room with great desk for work, a comfortable private bath and the big shared kitchen. Thank you Anna for all your support! Hope to see you soon! xxx

Our time here with Anna and Lee was a dream come true. Their place is unreal! Quiet, clean and cozy. If I close my eyes I can feel that delicate Malaysian breeze pouring through the open windows of their little palace. Note: it is a little outside of downtown for walking but catch a dollar uber ride (roughly) and you're there in 5-10 min. They were quite welcoming and had a good balance of giving you your privacy and also making you feel like part of the family. A time well cherished indeed. Check out TekSen for a memorable dinner and after check out the hole-in-the-wall spot Moody Cow for a slice of cheesecake that will blow your socks off into the sky. Safe travels kids!

The room itself is very comfortable and equipped as described on the ad with a mosquito net (life saver!!), a computer desk and, bonus points, fast and reliable WiFi. It's conveniently located at about 30 minutes walk from city center, but it only cost 5RM to Uber anywhere from their apartment. I strongly recommend booking this place! They really make you feel like you're right at home.

Also, her love about the plants is very inspiring and her effort for looking for a natural solution for the daily life. We learned a lot and absolutely recommended stay at Annas house. In the other hand, Penang was one of our best cities in our trip in south east, so you must come here!

Great place! Host was great about directing us to the place and getting us oriented. Overall great communication. Bed has the biggest and most effective mosquito net we've seen in SE Asia (a positive!). Would stay again.

We had a great time in Anna 's apartment. Our room was nice, the neighbourhood was quiet and clean and there was an awesome little restaurant in walking distance. If you wanna go to the city center it will take you approximately 30 min walking or you can take an uber for 8-10 ringit. Also, there is a very good wifi conection in the apartment.

Very peaceful and lovely environment. The set up is very simple and for someone who prefers to travel light, it has basically everything that you would need. Price is great too especially these days with the explosion of tourist in Penang, most places in Georgetown would be getting pricier or booked up. If you have a car or renting a bike, parking is great too!

Lovely place if you want to stay calm and nice area near Georgetown. I loved the desk setting, cause I worked at desk in every morning. Big sky and trees. What do you want more? Even there are some hidden gems of restaurants.

Anna's place was comfortable and the evening breeze was perfect, no AC wasn't a problem for my boyfriend and I. Its near a bus station and a beta public Linkbike system (10 min walk away) for the area which we used. Easiest way to get into the main area was by bike or grab/uber. The host, Anna was very relaxed and friendly which made her fun to chat with!!

Good stay in a clean apartment on the outskirts of town. Takes a little while to walk anywhere but there are facilities nearby. Host is lovely and is very attentive!

Anna's house is the perfect place to chill-out in a verdant, quiet and leafy neighborhood. Penang centre is only a short bus (or Uber) ride or half an hour walk away.

This place is ideal for people who prefer to be away from tourist area. It is a very quiet and peaceful area in town. We love our view from the window. Anna and Lee are very helpful and nice. Thanks for letting us stay at your place.

The home is in a quiet residential area, but still walkable to many cool shops, markets and restaurants, which is exactly what I was looking for. Anna and Lee are also very gracious, respectful and helpful hosts. I highly recommend them if you're like to be just outside of the noisy city scene.

Nearby the historic center of Georgtown, in a nice quiet local neighborhood. Stable Internet connection very good and fast, ecological healthy environment, had good sleeps on big mattress with big mosquito net. Good local information and tips, nearby to local food stalls and the night life of Georgtown. Beaches are just a bus ride away.

Nette Unterkunft, ca. 30 Minuten Fussweg in die Stadtmitte. in ca.10Min hat man einen kleinen Markt erreicht, zu dem haben Anna und Lee und auch einen morgen mitgenommen. Anna ist begeisterte Gärtnerin, interessiert sich sehr für Heilpflanzen und macht Kefir und Kombucha selber, wer diesem Thema zugeneigt ist, der fühlt sich hier auf jeden Fall wohl. Das Zimmer ist sehr groß, mit angeschlossenem privatem Badezimmer, einzig ein Schrank für Klamotten hat gefehlt. Das Bett war super.

Anna and Li are friendly and hospitable. As soon as I entred thier place I felt the rush of ariving in Penang slip away and I felt so calm and safe in thier clean, airy appartment. They are both very interesting and we had great chats about food, travel, and life, I feel like I learned so much! If you like a relaxing space, or are curious about kombucha or health foods, or you just want secure, easy accomodation in George Town these guys provide a great place to stay.

It was convenient and easily accessible via public bus and uber service. The only deterrent is it is located at the third floor of the apartment block. You need to have healthy knees to climb those stairs. Otherwise, I found this place comfortable and convenient.

Anna and Li where very friendly and social hosts. They have a fantastic knowledge on asia, health foods and technology. Although there is no use of A/C the ceiling fan is more then enough. The location is decent and a short uber away. Usally very quiet location and good when considering the location. Ask Anna to buy kombucha and kefir for a small fee! Thanks alot Li and Anna! We would definitely check back in of we ever came to Penang again!

Friendly, clean, welcoming and beautiful home. Walking distance of all the cool Pinang place. It's also in a quiet area that is close to hip local life and well connected to the rest of Pinang. This was such a lovely experience - Anna and her partner were extremely welcoming and attentive, but also gave us space to relax. It was interesting to know more about her work. Her experiments with food are great. Anna very talented. Hope we meet again.

We had a two days camp to attend at Macalister Road and decided to stay at Anna's apartment which is located at Dunn Road. It is a quiet street in between two busy roads. The location is quite good as restaurants and convenient stores are within walking distance. You could take uber or grab or bus to reach the place. We had a pleasant stay at Anna's house. She is very kind, helpful and friendly. She is also very eco-friendly as she does planting in her balcony and ferments enzyme on her own for cleaning. We love talking to her! We would love to stay here again if we go Penang.

Anna and Li are both very nice host! We shared a good time together, would like to meet you soon! The place is very close to the Thai embassy and not far from George town, use uber, then everywhere is close by and cheap! The apartment is full of green, very chill. Anna will show you how to be more organic while Li will discuss with you some IT related issues, they also showed me a local market nearby, very nice experience. I will highly recommend you to stay with them! You will enjoy it!
